history of present illness:  this is an 81-year-old female
with a history of emphysema (not on home o2), who presents
with three days of shortness of breath thought by her primary
care doctor to be a copd flare.  two days prior to admission,
she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to
admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain
oxygen saturation greater than 90%.  she has also been on
levofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and
presented to the  emergency room.

in the  emergency room, her oxygen saturation was
100% on cpap.  she was not able to be weaned off of this
despite nebulizer treatment and solu-medrol 125 mg iv x2.

review of systems is negative for the following:  fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,
gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,
palpitations, orthopnea.  is positive for the following:
chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with
exertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally
related, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.

past medical history:
1. copd.  last pulmonary function tests in 
demonstrated a fvc of 52% of predicted, a fev1 of 54% of
predicted, a mmf of 23% of predicted, and a fev1:fvc ratio of
67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator
treatment.  the fvc, however, does significantly improve with
bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible
air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive
ventilatory defect.  the patient has never been on home
oxygen prior to this recent episode.  she has never been on
steroid taper or been intubated in the past.
2. lacunar cva.  mri of the head in 
demonstrates mild degree of multiple small foci of high t2
signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres
as well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to
the right of midline.  the abnormalities, while nonspecific
in etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic
microvascular infarction.  there is no mass, lesion, shift of
the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  the major
vascular flow patterns are preserved.  there is moderate
right maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left
maxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal
thickening.  these abnormalities could represent an allergic
or some other type of inflammatory process.  additionally
noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella
turcica.
3. angina:  most recent stress test was in 
going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of
10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence
of ischemic ekg changes or symptoms.  the imaging portion of
the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and
a calculated ejection fraction of 84%.  the patient denies
angina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks.
are alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin.
4. hypothyroidism on synthroid.
5. depression on lexapro.
6. motor vehicle accident with head injury approximately 10
years ago.

medications on admission:
1. hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d.
2. prednisone 60 mg, 50 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg.
3. levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.
4. imdur 60 mg q.d.
5. synthroid 75 mcg q.d.
6. pulmicort nebulizer b.i.d.
7. albuterol nebulizer q.4. prn.
8. lexapro 10 mg q.d.
9. protonix 40 mg q.d.
10. aspirin 81 mg q.d.

allergies:  norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache.

family history:  noncontributory.

social history:  lives with her husband, dr.  an
eminent pediatric neurologist at .  the
patient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10
years.  she has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.

physical exam at time of admission:  blood pressure 142/76,
heart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%
axillary temperature.  she was saturating at 100% on cpap
with dry mucous membranes.  an elderly female in no apparent
distress.  pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  extraocular movements are intact.  oropharynx
difficult to assess due to cpap machine.  no evidence of
jugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the cpap
machine obscures the neck exam.  cranial nerves ii through
xii are grossly intact.  neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy.  heart exam:  tachycardic, regular, obscured
by loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory
phase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the
lung fields.  positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, obese, no masses.  mild edema of the lower
extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  there
is a right hand hematoma.  strength is assessed as  in the
lower extremities,  in the upper extremities with a normal
mental status and cognition.

laboratory studies:  white count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets
300.  chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  troponin was
negative.  cks were negative times three.  initial blood gas
showed a ph of 7.4, po2 of 66, pco2 of 54.

chest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,
segmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus
segmental atelectasis.

ekg shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal
axis, no evidence of st-t wave changes.

brief summary of hospital course:
1. copd/dyspnea/pneumonia:  the patient was initially placed
on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical
intensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation
despite cpap machine.  she was also given nebulizer
treatments q.4h. as well as chest pt.  the nebulizers were
increased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have
labored breathing.

due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,
the patient was intubated on  in order to improve
oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  a
bronchoscopy was performed on , which demonstrated
marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent
with tracheomalacia.

on , two silicone stents were placed, one in the left
main stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by dr.
  under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.

on , the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel
mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal
cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical
floor.  on the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off
on , and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2
liters, 92% on room air.

on , the patient was seen again by the interventional
pulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved
and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with
followup within six weeks' time status post placement of
stents in respiratory failure.

2. cardiovascular:  the patient was ruled out for a mi.  she
did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,
which showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative
troponin, negative cks x3.  she was continued on aspirin,
imdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient
regimen.

3. hypertension:  she was maintained on diltiazem and
hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and
normalization of electrolytes.

4. hematuria:  the patient had intermittent hematuria likely
secondary to foley placement.  the foley catheter was
discontinued on .  she had serial urinalyses, which
were all negative for signs of infection.

5. hyperglycemia:  patient was placed on insulin-sliding
scale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  this
worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels
once the steroids were tapered to off.

6. leukocytosis:  patient did have a profound leukocytosis of
20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  as the steroids
were tapered to off, her white blood cell count on 
was 15,000.  it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary
to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe
pneumonia.

7. for the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had
initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.
from  to .  this was restarted on 
for an additional seven day course given the fact that she
still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the
left lower lobe.

8. hypothyroidism:  the patient was continued on outpatient
medical regimen.

9. depression:  the patient was continued on lexapro per
outpatient regimen.  it is recommended that she follow up
with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she
did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital
course, and did appear clinically to be depressed.

10. prophylaxis:  she was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor
with subq heparin.

11. sore throat:  the patient did have a sore throat for much
of the hospital course post extubation.  this was treated
with cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid (a solution
containing kaopectate, bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.

12. communication/code status:  the patient was full code
throughout her hospital course, and communication was
maintained with the patient and her husband.

13. muscle weakness:  the patient did have profound muscle
weakness and was evaluated by physical therapy, and was found
to have impaired functional mobility, impaired
musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired
endurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine
to sit.  however, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair
for approximately one hour.

on motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower
extremities were  at the knee,  at the ankle,  at
the elbows, and  hips.  it was felt that this weakness was
most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well
as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a
prolonged hospital course.

14. speech/swallow:  the patient had a speech and swallow
evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of
vocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.

discharge condition:  the patient was able to oxygenate on
room air at 93% at the time of discharge.  she was profoundly
weak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood
pressure.  her respirations were much improved albeit with
transmitted upper airway sounds.

discharge status:  the patient will be discharged to 
for both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.

discharge medications:
1. levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.
2. citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
4. fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaled b.i.d.
5. salmeterol diskus one inhalation b.i.d.

7. ipratropium bromide mdi two puffs inhaled q.2h. prn.
8. albuterol 1-2 puffs inhaled q.2h. prn.
9. zolpidem tartrate 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn.
10. isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
11. diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d.
12. pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.24h.
13. trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn.
14. subq heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until such
time that the patient is able to get out of bed twice a day.
15. cepacol lozenges q.2h. prn.
16. levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a seven day course to
be completed on .
17. kaopectate/benadryl/lidocaine 5 ml p.o. b.i.d. prn, not
to be given around mealtimes for concern of dysphagia induced
by lidocaine.
18. lorazepam 0.5-2 mg iv q.6h. prn.

follow-up plans:  the patient is recommended to followup with
dr.  ,  within two weeks of leaving
of the hospital.  she is also recommended to followup with
the interventional pulmonary service for followup status post
stent placement.  she is also recommended to followup with a
neurologist if her muscle weakness does not improve within
one week on physical therapy with concern for steroid-induced
myopathy.

final diagnoses:
1. tracheomalacia status post tracheal and left main stem
bronchial stent placement.
2. hypertension.
3. hypothyroidism.
4. restrictive lung defect.
5. depression.

thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. no aortic
regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. there is no mitral valve prolapse. mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. there is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
impression: normal biventricular systolic function. moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

brief hospital course:
87 yo f with h/o chf, copd on 5 l oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, no s/p intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

# hypercarbic respiratory failure: presents with dyspnea, but no
clear cough or fevers. per report, patient felt like this with
prior copd exacerbations. leukocytosis supports possible
pneumonia, but history and cxr not entirely consistent with
this. ekg with signs of demand, but romi negative. sputum gram
stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew
parainfluenze type 3 on . patient was initially managed on
solumedrol 60 mg iv q8h, and was eventually tapered. with no
evidence of pneumonia on cxr and sputum gram stain, antibiotics
were stopped . beta-agonists and anticholinergics were
continued around the clock. tte revealed mild symmetric lvh with
normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmhg), normal rv, and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. on , bronchoscopy
revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. patient had
difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become
interimittenty hypertensive to sbp 200s and tachypnic to the
50s. patient was extubatied on  after passing sbt 0/5, but
required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening
secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. of
note, on , the patient was found to have mrsa growing in
sputum samples. although it was felt that this likely
represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the
patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped
after 5 days). after multiple discussions between the patient's
family and the icu team, the patient's pcp,  the palliative
care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she
would not want a tracheostomy. on , extubation was pursued
again and was successful. after extubation, her respiratory
status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical
floor. on the floor she was progressively weaned to 2lnc with
nebs (better than her baseline 5l @home). because of clinical
exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently
diuresed. she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath
with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks
of anxiety with tachypnea. after receiving prn morphine, her
breathing status would typically improve. a steroid taper was
begun. the patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3
more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4
days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.
.
# upper gi bleeding: on , patient had coffee grounds from og
tube. lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. gi perfomred egd
which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach
body, d2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. h pylori was
negative. patient was continued on iv ppi, with plan for repeat
egd in 8 weeks, and upper gi series once clinically improved
given abnormal anatomy on egd. her hematocrit remained stable
with no further episodes of upper gi bleeding throughout the
patient's hospitalization. on the floor she was switched to po
pantoprazole twice daily. aspirin was held.
.
# weakness: the patient was found to have generalized weakness
at the end of her hospitalization. neurology was consulted and
they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy
and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. a tsh was
checked which was normal. they recommended pulmonary and
physical rehab.
.
# cad: history of lad and rca stenosis on cath, but no stents.
continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for gi
bleeding (see above)
.
# nutrition: unable to pass ng without direct visualization due
to hiatal hernia. ir guided post pyloric ng tube was placed on
 for tfs and po medications. ng tube was pulled when patient
was extubated on . speech and swallow were consulted
following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved
to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.

# goals of care: pcp .  was very involved in discussions
regarding patient's code status. palliative care also followed
along with the patient. ultimately, at the time of the patient's
extubation on , it was decided that the patient would be
dnr/dni (although this was later change). the patient's family
felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. it was decided that
she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status
were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on
comfort. however, her status improved in the micu and on the
floor and it was then decided that she would remain dnr with
intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.
after several days with stable or improved overall clinical
status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. at the timem
of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,
okay to intubate.

ct scan c spine :
impression:
1.  fracture of the c6 as described involving the right pedicle
(extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. anterior
widening at the c6-7 disc space and mild widening of left c6-7
facet also noted. prevertebral hematoma at c6 with likely
rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

2.  lucency in the right posterior c1 ring may represent a
chronic injury.
likely old avulsion fracture at t2 pedicle on the left.

3. ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments with
compromise of the central spinal canal. degenerative disease is
further
described above.

ct abdomen/pelvis ()
impression:
1. no acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right
hemithorax, likely pseudotumors.
3. small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear
etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. further
evaluation with mri may be performed on a non- emergent basis.
4. bilateral renal cysts.
5. foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra.
recommend emergent repositioning.

ct sinus/maxillofacial ()
1. bilateral nasal bone fractures.
2. left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue
swelling. question foreign body anterior to the left globe.
recommend clinical correlation. small amount of extraconal
hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit.
3. linear lucency in the right posterior ring of c1. correlate
with ct c- spine performed concurrently.

head ct ()
1. no acute intracranial hemprrhage.
2. left frontal scalp hematoma.
3. nasal bone fractures. recommend correlation with report from
facial bone ct scan.
4. lucency in the right posterior ring of c1. please refer to
dedeicated ct c-spine for further detail.
5. left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old
infarction.

chest 
the dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most
likely terminating in the stomach. the bilateral pacemakers are
demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three
leads terminating in right ventricle. the patient is in mild
pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid
within the major fissure.

ct head 
1. a tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the
occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. recommend followp
imaging.
2. left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size.
3. unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
4. nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated
maxillofacial ct.

right shoulder x-ray ()
mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.
nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the
scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. diagnostic
considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis,
intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the
subscapularis tendon.
increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor
fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest
ct

right upper extremity ultrasound ()
1. deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending
proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to
involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the
right cephalic vein.
2. likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual
son features somewhat suspicious for malignancy.
followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and fna/biopsy
may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.


ct abdomen with iv contrast: there are small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated
appearance. there is associated compressive atelectasis. the
visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly.
there is no pericardial effusion. there is a 9-mm
hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the
liver () too small to accurately characterize but
statistically most likely representing a cyst. there are
bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. the spleen is normal
in size. there is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic
body, most likely representing focal fat. the gallbladder and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. an ng tube terminates in the
stomach. there is no ascites. the large and small bowel loops
appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. oral
contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without
evidence of obstruction. there is no ascites and no free air.
there is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle,
tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.

ct pelvis with iv contrast: the pelvic small and large bowel
loops, collapsed bladder containing foley catheter and seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. the prostate is enlarged,
measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. the rectum contains a
moderate amount of dried stool. there is no free air or free
fluid.

bone windows: no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. there is
dish of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. there also
are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large
acetabular osteophytes.

impression:
1. stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.
2. new focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with
associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (). no
associated stranding or fluid collection. please correlate
clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q.
injections.
3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. this could
represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded.
if this is of concern, then mri is again recommended for further
evaluation.
4. hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too
small to accurately characterize.
5. bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.
6. moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.

a wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed
by dr.   with dr.  at  p.m. on .


video oropharyngeal swallow findings: real-time video
fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration
of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the
speech pathologist.

oral phase: normal bolus formation, bolus control, ap tongue
movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.

pharyngeal phase: there is normal swallow initiation and velar
elevation. there is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal
elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. there is
moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. there is
residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate
impairment of bolus propulsion. there was aspiration of both
thin and puree barium.

impression: aspiration of thin liquids and puree. for additional
information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's
report from the same day.

 ct head w/out:
findings: there is a small amount of blood layering in the
occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not
as dense given evolution. no new hemorrhage is identified. the
ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to
involutional change. periventricular white matter hyperdensities
are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. encephalomalacia
in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is
unchanged. the osseous structures are unremarkable. the
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck
secondary to recent spinal surgery.

impression: no interval change with a very small
intraventricular hemorrhage.

no discharge labs as patient cmo.

brief hospital course:
mr.  was seen at  after his fall from a height
of approximatly 10 feet.  ct scans of his chest, abdomen and
pelvis were negative for pathology.  ct scan of his c-spine
showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at c6-7.  he
was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture.

c-spine fracture: mr.   two surgical
procedures to stabilized his c-spine.  : anterior
cervical decompression/fusion at c6-7.  : cervical
laminectomy c6-c7 & t1 with posterior cervical arthrodesis
c4-t1.  he tolerated the procedures well.  he was extubated
without complication.

after his surgical procedures, mr.  was transfered
to the medicine service at  for his medical care. while on
the medicine service, patient was found to be persistently
aspirating and failed his speech and swallow evaluation. patient
and family were not interested in an ng tube or peg for
nutrition. patient also developed a venous clot of the right
upper extremity and the decision was made to not proceed with
medical treatment. goals of care were changed to comfort
measures only. a foley was placed after patient had difficulty
with urinary retention and straight cathing. a palliative care
consult was obtained for symptom management and patient was
discharged to hospice with morphine, olanzapine, and a foley in
place for symptomatic relief.

history of present illness:
  is a 62-year-old woman, with longstanding
history of rheumatoid arthritis, probable sweet's syndrome, and
multiple joint complications requiring orthopedic interventions.
she was found to hve a right cavernous sinus and nasopharyngeal
mass.  she underwent a biopsy of hte nasopharyngeal mass by dr.
  and the pathology, including flow
cytometry,
was reactive for t-cell lymphoid hyperplasia only.

she has a longstanding history of rheumatoid arthritis that
involved small and large joints in her body.  her disease is
currently controlled by abatacept, hydroxychloroquine, and
methotrexate.  she also has a remote history of erythematous
nodules at her shins, dermatosis (probable sweet's disease),
severe holocranial headache with an intensity of , and
dysphagia.  but her symptoms resolved with treatment for
autoimmune disease.  please refer additional past medical
history, past surgical history, facial history, and social

she is neurologically stable without headache, nausea, vomiting,
seizure, imbalance, or fall. she has no new systemic complaints.

her neurological problem started  when she experienced
frontal pressure-like sensations.  there was no temporal
pattern;
but they may occur more often in the evening.
she had fullness in her ear and she also had a cold coinciding
to
the onset of her headache.  by late  and early , she also developed a sharp pain intermittently in the
right
temple region.
she did not have nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, imbalance, or
fall.  a gadolinium-enhanced head mri, performed at  on , showed a bright mass
involving the cavernous sinus.

past medical history:
she has a history of rheumatoid arthritis unspecified
dermatosis, right knee replacement, left hip replacement, and
fusion of subtalar joint, and resection of a benign left parotid
gland tumor.

 and his head ct showed growth of the left sphenoid
meningioma.  he is seizure free.  today, he is here with his
wife
and daughter.   does not have headache, nausea, vomiting,
urinary incontinence, or fall.

his neurological problem began on  when he became
confused and disoriented in a hotel bathroom.  at that time, he
was visiting his daughter for a wedding.  his wife found him
slumped over in the bath tube.  according to her, his eyes
looked
funny.  he could not stand up.  his verbal output did not make
sense.  he was brought to  hospital in placentia,
ca.  he woke up 7 to 8 hours later in the emergency room.  he
felt very tired after the event.  he was hospitalized from
 to .  he had a cardiac pacemaker placement due
to irregular heart rate and bradycardia.  he also had a head mri
that showed a less than 1 cm diameter sphenoid meningioma.

cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.  his lungs
are clear.  his abdomen is soft with good bowel sounds.  his
extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

neurological examination:  his karnofsky performance score is
100.  he is awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  there his
language is fluent with good comprehension.  his recent recall
is
intact.  cranial nerve examination:  his pupils are equal and
reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally.  extraocular
movements are full.  there is no nystagmus.  visual fields are
full to confrontation.  funduscopic examination reveals sharp
disks margins bilaterally.  his face is symmetric.  facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  his hearing is intact
bilaterally.  his tongue is midline.  palate goes up in the
midline.  sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.
motor examination:  he does not have a drift.  his muscle
strengths are  at all muscle groups.  his muscle tone is
normal.  his reflexes are 0 in upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.  his ankle jerks are absent.  his toes are
down going.  sensory examination is intact to touch and
proprioception.  coordination examination does not reveal
dysmetria.  his gait is normal.  he can do tandem.  he does not
have a romberg.

physical exam upon discharge:
non focal
incision c/d/i, dissolvable sutures

pertinent results:
 ct head: impression:
1. likely meningioma along the greater  of the left sphenoid
bone,
measuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent
study of , with reactive bony changes, as above.
2. bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly
over the series of studies since the earliest studies of .

 ct head: impression:
expected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy
including
subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate
pneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal
lobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed. no evidence
of residual tumor on this non contrast ct.

 cxr: findings: the lung volumes are rather low. there is
moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
no areas of atelectasis or pneumonia. right pectoral pacemaker
in situ, with correct lead placement.


 head ct /c contrast: impression: status post left frontal
craniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable
3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage
with/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in
appearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic
edema. stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage. followup to
assess for residual tumor/ interval change.


brief hospital course:
patient presented electively on  for left sided craniotomy
for mass resection. he tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the trauma icu post-operatively still intubated.
shortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was
done without difficulty. at post-op check he was neurologically
intact.
on  he was neurologically intact and cleared for transfer to
the stepdown unit. this did not happen due to bed shortage. a ct
with contrast was ordered for post op evaluation.
on  he was again stable and cleared for transfer to the
floor. decadron taper was initiated. he was seen by pt and
cleared for discharge home.
on  the patient was being prepped for discharge but was
noted to have intermittent heart rate in the 130-170's. his
other vitals were stable. electrophysiology was consulted and
they recommended increasing the metoprolol xl dose to 100mg
qday. the patient was kept overnight to monitor this new dose.
on  her remained stable neurologically and hemodynamically
therefore he was cleared for discharge.

attending:
chief complaint:
chest pain

major surgical or invasive procedure:
central venous line insertion (right internal jugular vein)

history of present illness:
mr.  is an 84 yo man with moderate aortic stenosis (outside
hospital echo in  with  1 cm2, gradient 28 mmhg, moderate
mitral regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency), chronic left
ventricular systolic heart failure with ef 25-30%, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cad s/p cabg in  with
svg-lad-diagonal, svg-om, and svg-rpda-rpl, with a re-do cabg in
 with lima-lad, svg-om, svg-diagonal, and svg-rca. he also
has severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass
surgery. he presented to  hospital er this morning with
shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart
failure.

he states he was in his usual state of health until  last
evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed
moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest
associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. the pain was
fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sl ntg at
6 am by ems. he has been pain free since. presenting vitals bp
109/66, hr 71, o2 sat 88% on ra. cxr showed congestive heart
failure; initial troponin-i was mildly elevated at 0.4, ck 70.
he given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg iv (with ~600cc diuresis),
nitropaste , and lovenox 80 mg sq. during the ambulance
transfer to the , he also received ~500 cc ivf for ? low
bp).

on further questioning, mr.  has very poor exercise
tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis.
but he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last
night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat,
carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to
walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). the pain is associated
with dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. his symptoms
occur about every day to every other day and have been stable
over the past year. he denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify
the amount of exertion required). currently, he is dyspneic and
feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.

ros is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ed visit several
months ago (and cessation of plavix for a few days), and
currently gross hematuria after foley placement and lovenox.

past medical history:
1. coronary artery disease s/p cabg twice (vide infra).
2. hypertension.
3. diabetes mellitus.
4. hyperlipidemia.
5. peripheral arterial disease with occluded left common iliac
artery, s/p right iliac artery stenting and femoral-to-femoral
bypass, further angioplasty to the right profunda.

patent svg to om1, patent svg to pda which filled the distal pda
as well as the r-pl via a jump segment. stump occlusion of a
graft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that
could be documented of a graft to the left. other svg's were not
able to be selectively engaged. supravalvular aortography
demonstrated no other patent grafts. patent lima to mid-lad,
which also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft
that was interposed between the lad and the diagonal.

rhythm is most likely sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular
premature beats with occasional ventricular bigeminal pattern.
there are also frequent atrial premature beats. intraventricular
conduction defect. left ventricular hypertrophy. st-t wave
changes most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy.
compared to the previous tracing of  ventricular premature
beats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. clinical
correlation is suggested.

cxr : the patient is after median sternotomy and cabg.
the heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the
previous study.  bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward
the lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe
pulmonary edema.  bilateral pleural effusion is present, also
new, most likely part of the heart failure.   left and right
retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.

echo : the left atrium is mildly dilated. there is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
there is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl
walls. there is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (lvef
= 25-30 %). no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
tissue doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (pcwp>18mmhg). right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. the
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. there is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild to
moderate (+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. there is no
pericardial effusion. compared with the prior report (images
unavailable of , left ventricular systolic function is now
depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.

brief hospital course:
patient is a 84 yo man with cad s/p cabg twice with daily
angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive
heart failure.

# cad: the patient was transferred to  for further workup
and treatment of chest pain. a chest x-ray performed on
admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. he did have a
stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart
failure or demand ischemia. he was started on a lasix drop at 10
mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. he initially tolerated this
well, however at approximately 8 pm on , mr.  was
transferred from the floor to the ccu after complaining of chest
pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. as he was being
evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and
developed pulseless electrical arrest. chest compressions were
started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became
responsive and regained a palpable pulse. his rhythm appeared to
be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the
50s but rising to the 110's. review of his telemetry showed that
he had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening
without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his
arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the
setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis).  on transfer to
the ccu, he was started on levophed for hypotension and
amiodarone iv for afib. chest x-ray on  showed interval
worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis.  at this time his cardiac enzymes became
very elevated with ekg changes consistent of a nstemi with a ck
to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. on , he had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. lvef was 25-30 %, with severe
aortic stenosis and + mitral regurgitation. he was
aggressively diuresed with an iv lasix drip with improvement in
his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray.  levophed was
discontinued on , and blood pressures remained stable off
pressors with map's 60 - 70.  on , he was transferred
back to the floor team on po amiodarone. he remained in normal
sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was
continued with a lasix drip with good urine output and
improvement of renal function. he remained asymptomatic with no
shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. he was
maintained on a heparin drip bridging to coumadin for paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. his metoprolol was held for hypotension in
the icu and relative hypotension with sbp in 90s and low 100s
upon transfer to the floor. ace-inhibitor was held due to
relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with creat 1.7. a
cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a
3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending
re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. the intermediate-term
plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and
discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist
regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.

on , the patient became hypotensive to sbps to
60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. he was given
1l ns with no response in bp. the patient was mentating but
became short of breath with ivf. he had worsening ekg changes.
he was started on levophed without improvement in his blood
pressure. he was brought to the catherization laboratory for
potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. at
that point, he suffered a pea arrest and could not be
resuscitated. he was pronounced deceased at 

# pump: as above. the patient had severe pulmonary edema with
initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. he
was treated with a lasix drip which was transitioned on  to
po lasix 80 mg po twice daily.

# rhythm: patient was in nsr on admission. on hd #2, he had
chest pain, then went into pea arrest as described above.
telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. in the
ccu, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered
over the subsequent weeks.

# acute renal failure: renal function initially declined
(creatinine to 2.1), then improved on lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7
- 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).

# hematuria: he had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic foley
placement at the outside hospital. the catheter was removed on
 with gradual resolution of hematuria.

# diabetes: due to acute renal failre, metformin was
discontinued and the patient was maintained on a humalog sliding
scale with 30 units of lantus at bedtime.

# hematoma. the patient developed a small hematoma at the site
of his right internal jugular venous access after catheter
removal. this was treated with local compression.

brief hospital course:
84 yo f w/ h/o cri, htn, h/o nephrotic syndrome, w/ diarrhea,
c.diff pos at rehab, failure to respond to flagyl, w/ elev wbc,
and negative ct. a brief-problem based hospital course is
outlined below.

1) presumed c.diff infxn- admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin
and iv metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad
spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. cholestyramine was
initially given for toxin binding. wbc was 30 on admission and
trended down with abx; however, c.diff toxin neg x5, so
diagnosis remains presumptive.  c. diff b toxin was sent and was
negative as well. she completed a 3 week course of po vanco and
iv flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on . she
subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was
able to tolerate po's.

2)  pt began having episodes of brbpr on  with
resultant slow hct drop. gi and surgery were consulted. pt had
no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we
were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel
or dehiscence. pt was also having intermittent episodes of
tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic
phenomena with acute ischemia. however, she had no abdominal
pain to suggest this. colonoscopy was done on , showing
severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. surgery found that pt was not
surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage
was  c dif and would continue to improve. biopsy results
showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po
vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin b. it is
quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were
the result of c dif infxn, which had been treated w/abx and
resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. as well, gi felt there
may be a superimposed ischemic insult. no further work-up was
performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis,
following completion of cdiff treatment.

2) acute renal failure w/ cri-  renal team was consulted on
admisison.  baseline cr is approx 2.0.  on admission this was
significantly elevated to 4.1.  fena was c/w prerenal etiology
and patient had r ij placed in ed, started on ns for volume
resusciation.  this was undertaken slowly given that pt had an
albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on ct.  fluids
were changed to 1/2ns w/ bicarb on hd2. cr trended down each day
and the patient has maintained oxygenation.   alb/cr ratio not
c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low
alb was likely multifactorial. pt initially required boluses of
500cc ns to maintain uop ~20-30cc/hr. with hydration and
improvement in her diarrhea, her cr steadily decreased and
returned to baseline of 1.6. she was seen by renal who felt that
her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to
atn/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive
overdiuresis. she did subsequently require aggressive diuresis
given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips.
however her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with
diuresis. she did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which
was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. therefore her
lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down
to 30. her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of
discharge.

3)  pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic
on admisison.   unclear why it was low when patient presented.
most likely  extreme inflammatory/sirs response (given elev
lactate on admission). her plt count dropped to 95 and dic
workup and hit ab were sent, both negative. her plt count rose
as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range
for the duration of her hosital course.

4) htn - pt's baseline sbp is in the 180s-200s range. on
admission, bp was low  3rd spacing and early sepsis. her bp
responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive.
she was continued on metoprolol for hr/bp control and
isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction.

5) chf - evidence of chf on initial cxr. her ef was found to be
40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event
precipitating her failure. in support of this she was noted to
have wall motion abnormalities on echo with inferoseptal/basal
hypokinesis. diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to
her renal insufficiency and decompensated chf. she was managed
medically, and on  the chf service was consulted for
management. she was initiated on aggressive diuresis with iv
lasix for goal -1.5l per day. she was transferred to the ccu
briefly on  for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her
chf (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative
approximately 500 cc overnight). she was transferred back to the
floor on lasix boluses.

due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg
iv  + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. then started
nesiritide  (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min.
diuresed well to this and maintained bp well, however after
increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. stopped
natrecor on . stopped lasix gtt on  given persistent
good diuresis. now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day +
afterload reduction w/ isordil/hydral on . at the time of
discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching
ins and outs daily. we will continue her on this regimen upon
discharge.

7.  atrial fibrillation: initially converted from raf by medical
cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the ccu at
13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. became
hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. then
again went into raf on  early am. initially hr controlled w/
iv lopressor/iv dilt. then  medical cardioversion w/
procainamide. became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10
minutes on procainamide ,  this was stopped and her blood
pressures normalized. she then converted 10 min later to nsr.
she has been in nsr the remainder of her hospital course. she is
not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. in addition, amiodorone
was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control.
however, given the side effect profile, the family and patient
were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at
this time. they understand that there is a higher risk of
conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for
stroke without amiodorone.  we will continue rate control with
metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg tid, and may titrate up as
needed to maintain hr <80.

8. cad- wall motion abnormalities on echo w/ inferoseptal/basal
hk. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical
management. on statin/b-blocker. no plan for cath at this time
given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. also holding off on
aspirin currently given her bleed risk. this will be
re-addressed as an outpatient through her pcp . .

9. anemia- initially had episode of gi bleed with blood loss
anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. hematocrit
subsequently normalized. however, she subsequently was noted to
have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. repeat stool
guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of
bleed or hemolysis. iron stores were also found to be within
normal limits, with low tibc and high ferritin suggesting anemia
of chronic disease. this was felt likely secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency. she was started on epo 2,000 units q m,w,fr
on . the goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her
history of cad, however, we have held off on further transfusion
at this time given her known chf with recent severe volume
overload. we have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused
with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg iv lasix for hct
<28.

10. tachypnea- resolved. her transient tachypnea was felt likely
secondary to volume overload. there was no evidence of
infiltrate by cxr. her abg at the time on  showed
7.29/43/99. her respiratory status subsequently improved that
same day on  following iv lasix and atrovent nebulizers.
avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia.

11. f/e/n- started on tpn for nutritional supplementation. she
also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated
regular solids and thin liquids. she has been taking in po's as
tolerated, but has continued to require tpn to reach nutritional
goals. this will be continued upon discharge at rehab.

history of the present illness:  mr.  is a 37-year-old
male who was stabbed by a four inch knife to the left upper
abdomen.  in the field, his blood pressure was 120/palpable,
heart rate 120.  a pressure dressing was applied to the
wound.  reportedly, the knife penetrated about 1.5 inches.

past medical history:
1.  hiv positive for 21 years.
2.  history of intravenous drug abuse.
3.  hypertension.
4.  congestive heart failure.
5.  right above the knee amputation after being hit by a

allergies:  the patient has an allergy to penicillin.

physical examination on admission:  vital signs:  temperature
97.3, heart rate 116, blood pressure 140/palpable,
respiratory rate 16, pulse oximetry of 100%.  general:  he
was alert and oriented times three with a gcs of 15.  heent:
normocephalic, atraumatic.  extraocular motions were intact.
the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  the oropharynx was clear.  the tms were
clear.  chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally with no
subcutaneous air noted.  cardiac:  no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  regular rate and rhythm.  abdomen:  there was a 1.5
cm left upper quadrant wound, otherwise diffusely tender.
back:  no step-off.  no deformities.  nontender.
extremities:  a right above the knee amputation with
prosthesis.  left leg with chronic venostasis changes.
rectal:  good tone.  contaminated by external blood.
neurological:  no focal deficits.

laboratory data upon admission:  chemistries generally normal
with creatinine of 1.2.  blood gas 7.39/49/341/31/4, lactate
2.5, amylase 107, fibrinogen 171.  pt 15.8, ptt 36.1, inr
1.7.  his white blood count was 5.1, hematocrit 34.4.  urine
toxicology was not performed.

a chest x-ray was within normal limits, status post left
subclavian line placement which was in place.

hospital course:  the patient was taken to the operating room
for wound exploration directly from the trauma room.  the
patient was taken to the operating room, as mentioned above,
for an exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions,
and control of rectus and omental bleeding.  the estimated
blood loss was approximately 1,000 cc.  please see the
operative note dictated by dr.  on  for
complete report.

the patient was then transferred to the sicu where his
coagulopathy was corrected.  he received 4 units of packed
red cells, 4 units of ffp, and 1 cryoprecipitate.

while on the unit, he was extubated on , sicu
day number three and he was noted to have progressive
thrombocytopenia.  his home p.o. medications were restarted
as well.

on , hospital day number four, the patient
was transferred to the floor.  his diet was advanced and he
was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to get his bowels
moving postsurgically.  the pain service was also consulted
because of the patient's history of narcotic abuse and his
continued complaints of pain.  they recommended increasing
his dose of klonopin and starting msir.

on hospital day number five, the patient was noted to have a
heparin-induced antibody which may be one of the reasons he
was coagulopathic on admission, although his hiv disease and
other drug abuse cannot be ruled out as cause.  his platelet
count remained relatively stable, however, as did his
hematocrit.

by hospital day number six, the patient was doing somewhat
better; however, after being noted to be somewhat sedated,
his klonopin dose as well as msir and methadone were
decreased.  the patient did work with physical therapy and
was able to ambulate, hop a bit out of bed.

additionally, case management spoke with the patient's
long-term nurse practitioner, who stated that at baseline he
normally uses a wheelchair and occasionally walks on his
prosthesis.  additionally, the nurse practitioner stated that
the patient does chronically abuse drugs, both prescriptions
and illicits, and advised not to give the patient any pain
prescriptions upon discharge as he had more than enough at
home.  it was also discussed that the patient would often try
to prolong his hospital courses in the past in an attempt to
get more narcotics.

on the date of discharge, the patient will be set up with vna
services for home to change his dressings.  he will also be
instructed to follow-up with his primary care doctor or
trauma clinic to have the staples removed from his abdominal
wound.

condition on discharge:  stable.

discharge status:  discharged to home with services.

discharge medications:  same as on admission.

follow-up plans:  as mentioned above, with the trauma clinic
and his primary care doctor.

brief hospital course:
41 year old male with hiv/aids, previous r-sided endocarditis
and severe tr, presented in cardiac tamponade from
rehabilitation.

cardiac tamponade:  on admission, he was transferred to the
cardiac catherization lab, where over one liter of fluid was
drained from his pericardial space.  the fluid was sent for gram
stain, culture, afb, , tb pcr as well as viral studies and
cytology.  a pericardial drain was initially left in place, but
given minimal drainage over 24 hours, was pulled prior to his
transfer to the floor.  the etiology of the pericardial effusion
is unknown.  he was followed by cardiology on the floor and the
initial plan was for a pericardial window, for both tissue and
to prevent reaccumulation of fluid.  the patient refused the
procedure at this time.  he will follow up as an outpatient to
re-evaluate for the procedure.  the effusion was followed by
serial echo while the patient was in the hospital.  there was no
evidence of re-accumulation.  he is scheduled for an outpatient
echo in several weeks to evaluate the pericardial space for
reaccumlation of effusion.

atrial fibrillation/flutter: per multiple ekgs, the patient
appears to have developed new a fib/flutter.  given his guaiac
positive stools, it is not advisable to start anticoagulation at
this time.  the patient is being rate controlled on a low dose
of beta-blocker, which appears to be effective.  he will be
followed by outpatient cardiology.

anemia: the patient had a hematocrit drop during this admission.
 his lab studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
however, the patient was found to have guaiac positive stools.
gi was consulted and recommeded colonoscopy and egd.  the
patient was unable to tolerate the prep and thus the colonoscopy
was cancelled.  his egd demonstrated gastritis and thrush.  he
was started on fluconazole to treat the thrush.  he was also
transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an
appropriate hematocrit response.

hiv/aids:  the patient had a cd4 count checked during his last
admission, it was found to be 132 with a viral load >100k.
given his past noncompliance with haart therapy and the risk of
developing drug resistant hiv,  haart was not restarted.  pt is
willing to restart harrt, and the plan remains to restart
medications at rehabilitation.  bactrim was continued for pcp
.

osteomyelitis:  the patient was previously admitted for left
ankle pain.  he was followed previously by both the orthopedic
and id services.  both services continued to follow the patient
on this admission.  the patient was continued on 6 weeks of iv
antibiotics (last day of cefazolin ), although the dose
was decreased to 1g q6 because of a low white blood count.

severe tricuspid regurgitation: pt with known grade 4 tr and
flail leaflet which he deveoped after acute bacterial
endocarditis roughly 10 years ago.  we restarted his lasix and
spironolactone on this admission.

hcv: hcv viral load checked, and found to be 1.5 million.  no
further therapy initiated.

anxiety: pt with history of anxiety and on klonapin at home.
his home regimen was continued.

esophageal candidiasis: patient was found to have thrush on egd.
 he was started on a course of fluconazole given his
immunosupressed state.  he is being discharged to complete a two
week course of anti-fungal medication.

history of present illness:  this is an 81-year-old female
with a history of metastatic melanoma with known metastases
to the liver and lung who status post resection in the 90s
with recurrence in  status post treatment with taxol.

she presented to the emergency room on ,
with altered mental status, decreased p.o. intake, confusion
and headache over several weeks, and was found to have three
mass lesions in her brain on head ct.

the patient was started on decadron, as well as dilantin.  in
the emergency room she became hypertensive and was sent to
the sicu.  she was maintained on nipride gtt.

in the intensive care unit, the patient was weaned off
nipride and then changed to labetalol, hydralazine. the patient
was also noted to have cellulitis on her left knee and was
initially maintained on vancomycin and later changed to keflex.

the patient was also evaluated by radiation/oncology, and it
was decided that the patient would received a total of seven
treatments of whole brain radiation therapy in conjunction
with decadron, as well as dilantin.

during her intensive care unit stay, the patient had
increased alertness and was more oriented, although she does
have a history of baseline dementia.

past medical history:  metastatic melanoma status post
resection in  with recurrence in  status post
treatment with taxol.  history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation with anticoagulation in the past.  status post
pcm for sinoatrial dysfunction.  history of coronary artery
disease status post myocardial infarction in .  mibi in
 showed an ejection fraction of 50%.  history of
hypercholesterolemia.  history of hypertension,
osteoarthritis, cellulitis.  status post skin graft.  peptic
ulcer disease.  history of bladder cancer.  chronic renal
insufficiency.

allergies:  amoxicillin, oxacillin and percocet, reactions
unknown.

medications on admission:  imdur 30 mg, warfarin, lasix 20
q.d., calcium carbonate 1500 q.d., vitamin d 4000 q.d.,
colace 100 mg b.i.d., protonix 40 q.d., dietrol 2 mg b.i.d.,
labetalol 300 mg b.i.d., lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

social history:  the patient is a home health aide.  husband
died three months ago.  she walks but recently was unable to
do so.  she otherwise has a very close family.

family history:  on maternal side there is a history of
diabetes, as well as hypertension.

physical examination:  vital signs:  temperature 96.5??????, blood
pressure 161/47, pulse 74, respirations 14, oxygen saturation
98% on 2 l, 92% on room air.  general:  she was elderly,
lying in bed.  she was sometimes agitated and not following
commands.  she was nonverbal.  heent:  normocephalic,
atraumatic.  pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
extraocular movements intact.  dry mucous membranes.  there
was poor dentition.  neck:  supple.  no lymphadenopathy.
heart:  regular, rate and rhythm.  there was an early
systolic ejection murmur, 3 out of 6.  lungs:  clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  abdomen:  soft, nontender,
nondistended.  good bowel sounds.  extremities:  there were
bilateral skin eschars.  the left knee had excoriation and
was erythematous.  neurological:  the patient was obtunded
and not following commands.  she had a limited neurologic
exam.  cranial nerves ii, iii and iv intact.  she was moving
both hands with appropriate strength.  no lifting of left arm
off bed.  right lower extremity with decreased strength,
apparently chronic secondary to polio.  on the left lower
extremity, she moved toes and feet.

laboratory data:  on admission her white count was 6.4,
hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 269, neutrophils 73, 22
lymphs, 3 monos; inr 1.1, pt 12.7, ptt 27.8; sodium 138,
potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarb 22, bun 36, creatinine
1.8, baseline 1.4-1.5; platelet count 151; calcium 10.6,
magnesium 1.9, phos 3.1, ck 116, mb 5, troponin 0.04; albumin
4.2; tsh 2.9; urinalysis with occasional bacteria, trace
ketones, 30 protein.

electrocardiogram was paced, lateral t-wave inversion,
inferior t-wave inversion which new consistent with .

head ct showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in
the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and
left parietal lesion with significant edema.  there was a
small amount of peripheral density, question of hemorrhage or
calcification.

chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt
failure.

knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and
degenerative changes with small right knee effusion.

hospital course:  1.  altered mental status:  this was felt
to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.  the
patient was evaluated by radiation/oncology, and it was
decided that the patient would receive a total of seven
treatments of whole-brain radiation therapy.

additionally she was maintained on decadron, as well as
dilantin.  the patient had no seizure activity while in the
hospital.  she tolerated her decadron well and tolerated her
whole-brain radiation therapy without any complications.

the patient was discharged on a decadron taper.  her dilantin
dose was increased to a total of 300 three times a day, given
that her dilantin level .i.d. was only 8.  the
patient will need her dilantin level followed as an
outpatient at her next appointment.

2.  hypertension:  the patient's blood pressures while in the
emergency room were noted to be 200/100; however, once she
was transferred to the floor, she maintained very good
control on a combination of clonidine, hydrochlorothiazide
and minoxidil, hydralazine, as well as labetalol 400 b.i.d.
the patient's blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to
160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an
appropriate range given that the patient needed to have
adequate perfusion in the face of increased
intracranial pressure.

3.  cellulitis:  the patient was initially maintained on
vancomycin, and this was later changed to keflex.  the
patient did not develop any rash or other complications
keflex.  her cellulitis was improved by the time of
discharge.

4.  renal insufficiency:  her creatinine remained at baseline
between 1.4-1.5.

5.  coronary artery disease:  the patient was maintained on
enteric coated aspirin, as well as labetalol.  the patient
ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her
electrocardiogram remained stable without any ekg changes.

6.  fen:  the patient was maintained on a soft diet, as well
as thin liquids.  she tolerated this without event.
additionally her electrolytes were followed daily and were
repleted as needed.  her i&os were monitored closely.

7.  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  the patient is paced.
she was rate controlled.  she was held off all
anticoagulation given her metastatic disease to the brain.

disposition:  the patient was discharged to her home because
her family wanted the patient to do so.  the patient has 
full-time nurses that will be following her once she is
discharged to home.  her mental status improved greatly while
the patient was in the hospital.  by the time of discharge,
the patient was conversive and much more alert and oriented.

her neurologic exam was significant for intact cranial nerves
and the ability to move all extremities spontaneously.  she
did have limited movement in her arms, given that she has a
history of bursitis.  otherwise, the patient's exam
neurologically was much improved.

condition on discharge:  stable.  she was stable on room air.
she could not ambulate without assistance and does need help
with all bed transfers.  she was tolerating a p.o. diet
without problems.   mental status had improved
considerably in that she was conversant, could move her
extremities spontaneously, and cranial nerves were intact.
her strength was notable for weakness throughout but was
symmetric.

discharge diagnosis:
1.  metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, lung
and brain.
2.  hypertension.
3.  hypercholesterolemia.
5.  osteoarthritis.
6.  bursitis.
7.  cellulitis.
8.  chronic renal insufficiency.
9.  coronary artery disease.
10. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

discharge status:  as stated above, the patient will be
discharged to home with  nursing care.  home hospice
has been discussed with the family, and they would like to
avail this possibility as the need arises.

discharge medications:  fluconazole nitrate powder to be
applied b.i.d. as needed, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg 1 p.o.

discharge labs:

brief hospital course:
primary reason for admission
70yof with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (ef 35%), aicd p/w sob and
poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia,
now transferred from medicine to ccu due to hypotension.
.
active issues:
.
#acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  the patient was
hypervolemic on exam with elevated jvp and increased abdominal
distension at presentation.  given the patient had been
refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during
her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on
admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic
therapy. she experienced significant muscle cramping and
hypotension while on cvvhd requiring dopamine. cvvhd was
discontinued on hd#2 and she was diuresed with iv lasix and
metolazone. pressures improved and she was weaned off of
dopamine.  it was noted that urine and blood pressure improved
when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with
asynchronous ventricular pacing.  therefore the patients
pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native
rhythm and the mode was changed to aair.  despite this change
urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a
lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis.
on hd#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis
catheter, and on hd#7 she continued hd using the tunneled line
(see below). lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient
will be hd dependent.
.
#hypotension:  patient was hypotensive on admission in the
setting of volume overload.  her hypotension was believed to be
due to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated
cardiomyopathy. she was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this
was weaned by hd#2.  in addition, she experienced episodes of
hypotension with cvvh with diuresis and antihypertensive
medications, so her antihypertensive medications were held. on
discharge, her bp was stable.  she was asked to continue to hold
her carvedilol and to follow up with her pcp about restarting as
tolerated.
.
# hyponatremia: pts sodium was 119 on admission and likely cause
of her ams, thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia with poor
renal perfusion given e/o volume overload on exam and low urine
na. her fluid intake was restricted to 1.5l daily, and she
started cvvh as above with improvement in her hyponatremia as
well as her mental status.  at the time of discharge her sodium
was 135.
.
# acute on chronic renal failure: patient was noted to have a
creat of 5.4, baseline 3.5-4.0, and oliguria x 2-3 days on
admission. as stated above she had previously required
ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure
exacerbation.  renal was consulted and felt that the patient
would require chronic hd.  given her hypotension she was
initally started on cvvh with dopamine gtt for pressure support.
 however as above she did not tolerate cvvh and it was
discontinued.  she was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as
above until she had her tunneled line placed on hd#6.  she
tolerated hd well, with stable bp and no muscle cramping.
outpatient dialysis was arranged with   dialysis
center for s, s and s.
.
# afib: pt has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin at
home.  on admission her coumadin was held in preparation for
placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. as stated above her
pacemaker settings were changed and she was in sinus rhythm for
most of her ccu course with heart rates in the 50-70s.  her mode
was changed to aair to allow for intrinsice av conduction and
minimize ventricular pacing in an abnormal heart. her coumadin
was restarted at her home dose on hd#7.  her inr at the time of
discharge was 1.4.

# stable issues:
.
# copd: patient's recent cough and sob with h/o copd was
initially c/f copd exacerbation, and she was initially started
on prednisone and levofloxacin. however there was no wheezing on
exam therefore prednisone and antibiotics were discontinued. she
was continued on her home albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer
treatments, and maintained o2 sats >90% on 2l nc (her baseline
o2 requirement).
.
# cad: stable, no c/o chest pain during hospitalization.  she
was continued on her home asa and pravastatin.
.
# htn: carvedilol was discontinued due to frequent episodes of
hypotension (with sbp 70s-80s).  she can resume as an outpatient
if bp tolerates.
.
# gout: patient was continued on her home allopurinol and did
not have any pain concerning for a gout flare.
.
# transitional issues:
- patient maintained full code status throughout
hospitalization.
- she will continue outpatient hemodialysis at  
dialysis center
- she has follow-up scheduled with her pcp and her cardiologist.
 she will be contact regarding a follow-up appointment with
the device clinic in 3 months.

discharge instructions:
it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the
hospital.

you were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and
not making urine. your heart was not pumping well which caused
you to have extra fluid.  we gave you medication to help you to
urinate out this fluid however your kidneys were not working
properly and you needed dialysis to do the job of your kidneys.
you got a special iv to be used for dialysis. you will need to
continue going to dialysis three times a week. your blood
pressure was also so low so we did not give you your home blood
pressure medications while you were in the hospital.

you should continue to go to dialysis three times a week.  you
were also started on a medication called nephrocaps that you
will need to continue.

you should stop taking your carvedilol, metolazone,
spironolactone and lasix unless your doctor instructs you to
restart these medications.

continue your coumadin and amiodarone for your abnormal heart
rhythm (atrial fibrillation).  continue your aspirin and
pravastatin for your heart disease, your allopurinol for your
gout, your albuterol and ipratropium for your copd.

extremity presented with inreased pain and erythema and elevated
wbc consistent with cellulitis.  she was recently treated for
cellulitis in that leg with vancomycin on previous
hospitalization in . after two days of vancomycin, she
had marked improvement in the leg with decreased erythema in
color and was dramatically receeding from the marked border
below the area. there was still +pitting edema in the left
thigh, but improved compared to admission when it was harder and
was obscuring the anatomical markings of the knee on extension.
leni of the leg was negative for dvt.  she was seen by vascular
surgery during this admission, who did not feel that surgery was
indicated and agreed with the proposed medical management.

-ciprofloxacin 500mg po qday x 2 weeks (last day )
.
#hypotension - patient hypotensive to sbps in 80s. in the ed
there was concern that she was possibly septic, so she was
admited to the icu. she received 1.5l of iv fluids and her bp
repsonded well. her baseline blood pressure is in the low 90s
systolic.  after being on the floor she continued to have lower
blood pressures and was asymptomatic with them.
-she will require monitoring of her blood pressure during

admitted to the icu and resuscitated. he was transfused 2 units
of prbcs for a hct of 22, and 2 units of ffp to reverse his
anticoagulation. he was also given vitamin k. the following day
he was transfused 4 more units of prbcs. the gi service was
consulted and 2 attempts were made to do a colonoscopy. both
attempts were aborted due to a poor preparation. after 3 days in
the icu, mr.  hct was stable at 26-27. he was
transferred to the floor and given 1 more unit of prbcs for
borderline urine output. his hct then stabilized at 28-29. since
he had no more episodes of bloody bowel movements, it was felt
that there was no need to make further attempts at colonoscopy.
his diet was then slowly advanced, physical therapy evaluated
the patient, and he was discharged to rehab on hd 7. he will

discharge diagnosis:
lower gi bleed


discharge condition:
stable


discharge instructions:
  you are being discharged from the hospital after an admission
for a lower gastrointestinal bleed.  because of significant
blood loss, you were stabilized throughout the admission with
transfusion of blood products and clotting proteins.  you
underwent colonoscopy to evaluate for source of the bleeding.
it not only showed multiple areas of sick colon consistent with
your chron's disease, but also a non-bleeding ulcer in the
bowel.  multiple biopsy's were taken, results pending.  the most
likely cause of your bleeding is your very low ability to clot
due to a reaction between your blood thinner coumadin and the
asacol which you started.  both medications are being stopped,
and only restarted after discussion between your pcp and your
gastroenterologist.
   after being evaluated by physical therapy, it is felt that
you would benefit from a short stay in an acute rehab facility
to help improve your strength after this hospitalization.

: echo
la is normal in size. no asd is seen by 2d or color doppler.
there is mild symmetric lv hypertrophy. lv cavity is moderately
dilated. there is a sessile mural thrombus at the lv apex; the
clot is mural and not mobile. overall lv systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (lvef= 30 %) secondary to
severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral
walls, and extensive apical akinesis. there is no vsd. rv
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. the ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. av leaflets are mildly thickened but as is not
present. mild (1+) ar is seen. mv leaflets are mildly thickened.
there is no mvp. mild (1+) mr is seen. lv inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. the estimated pa systolic pressure
is normal. there is no pericardial effusion.

compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of , a lv apical
thrombus is now present

 stress test:
impression: no significant st-t wave changes in the setting of
baseline
st-t wave abnormalities. no anginal-type symptoms. nuclear
report sent
separately.

 pmibi:
impression: 1. abnormal study. 2. severe, fixed perfusion defect
involving the inferior wall and the a large region at the apex.
3. moderately dilated lv. 4. akinetic apex and inferior wall
with lvef 28%.

 mri abdomen
impression:
1. hypodense flat subcapsular lesion within segment iv-b on
prior ct from , demonstrates a slight delayed
enhancement; however gross stability since  ct abdomen
and pelvis suggest a benign lesion. this lesion is amenable to
further evaluation by targeted ultrasound, possibly with biopsy,
as clinically indicated.
2. vague 1.3 cm lesion in segment 7 on prior ct from 
is not clearly visualized. however, this examination is motion
limited and a small lesion within this vicinity cannot entirely
be excluded.
3. filling defect in the lower common bile duct suggests
choledocholithiasis without evidence of acute obstruction.

 ct chest/abd/pelvis w/ w/o contrast
1) 3.7 cm irregular soft tissue mass at the lateral aspect of
the ascending colon, associated with lymph nodes, corresponding
to the colon cancer seen on colonoscopy. small amount of fluid
along the right paracolic gutter, probably due to biopsy. 2)
featureless appearance of the descending and sigmoid colon, with
increased wall thickening and fat stranding in the descending
colon, suggestive of active inflammation due to crohn's disease.

3) ill-defined 1.3 cm lesion in the segment 7 of the liver, for
which metastasis is suspected given the colon cancer. further
evaluation by multiphasic mri is recommended.
4) unchanged nodular appearance of the left adrenal gland. the
finding can be evaluated at the time of mri as well.
6) new bilateral pleural effusion.
7) increased mucosal enhancement in the perianal region, with
probable perianal fistula on the right, new since prior study.
8) multiple hypodense lesions in the kidney, unchanged since
prior study.

has been feeling weak over the last 3 weeks with an
unintentional 10 lb weight loss (of note over the last 2 months
she has lost 20lbs).  1 week ago she started feeling sob with

chest (portable ap) study date of   am
impression: diffuse hazy opacities within both lungs, without
evidence for volume overload. findings are most concerning for a
diffuse infectious process, likely with atypical organisms. if
the patient is immunocompromised, pcp should be considered.


brief hospital course:
on admission there was high index of suspicion for pcp given the
appearance on chest x-ray and a significant amount of
oropharyngeal thrush. bronchoscopy with bal on  was
positive for pcp.  was presumptively started on bactrim and
prednisone treatment in the emergency department. she was
consented for hiv testing and it came back positive with a
viral load (vl) of 114,000 and a cd4 of 8. her oxygenation was
tenuous initially requiring face mask with desaturation to the
high 70 with movement to the commode but she did not require
intubation. over the course of her treatment she was transition
ed to face tent and eventually to 4-5 l of oxygen via nasal
cannula. her overall oxygenation minimally improved very slowly
despite bactrim with a prolonged steroid taper. she was finally
discharged home with o2 supplementation of  l to keep o2 sat
at 94 % at rest. her hypoxia was related to the pcp .
for confirmation, she underwent cta of the lung which was
negative for pulmonary embolism. the ct did show diffuse ground
glass opacities as well as lymphadenopathy without effusions
consistent with the diagnosis of pcp.  her exertional
hypoxia, she remained well with minimal symptoms (only mild
dyspnea with activity but no significant cough and no fever or
chest pain). patient remained in the hospital for several extra
days hoping that her hypoxia will improve. it did remain stable
at the above level without any additional symptoms (4-5 l at
rest with o2 sat at 94 with decrease to 87-85 with activity.
without oxygen, her o2 sat will decrease to 76 with activity).
in regards to the new diagnosis of aids(aids defining illness
and cd4 of 8), her toxoplasma igg was positive. she was started
on azithromycin for  prophylaxis. id was consulted and will
follow her closely as an outpatient ( 3 days after discharge).
hiv genotyping was sent and was pending at the time of
discharge. the patient has a history of hypertension and was
continued on home dose of atenolol 50 mg daily.  bp was well
controlled despite holding amlodipine/chlorthalidone and these
were not restarted on discharge. she did have elevation of her
liver function tests on presentation. work up included negative
hepatitis serologies and ruq ultrasound (mild fatty
infiltration). lfts abnormalities were related to pcp pneumonia,
fatty liver, or both. blood afb culture and hcv viral loads are
pending and will be followed by her id. she was discharged home
without vna, the latter would offer little help as she had no to
minimal symptoms. total discharge time 56 minutes.

cxr (): as compared to the previous radiograph, there
is no relevant change. no pathologic mediastinal widening.
borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. presence of minimal
pleural effusions cannot be excluded. no focal parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia. no pulmonary edema.
.
ct neck and chest w/ contrast ():
1. interval slight decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid
collection and
improved airway patency.
2. no evidence of lemierre's disease or new abscess formation.

3. no evidence of extension of the fluid collection into the
mediastinum. no evidence of mediastinitis.
.
chest ct (): impression:
1. rapidly enlarging multiloculated right pleural effusion. this
could be due to empyema considering clinical suspicion for this
entity, but definitive diagnosis would require correlation with
thoracentesis results.
2. small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in
size since the prior study but does not have loculated
components.
3. slight increase in size of pre- and sub-carinal lymph nodes
as well as right hilar nodes. these are likely reactive.
4. ground-glass opacities in left upper lobe which are likely
infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
.
tte (): the left atrium is mildly dilated. no atrial septal
defect is seen by 2d or color doppler. left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (lvef >55%). there is no ventricular septal defect. right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. no masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. no aortic regurgitation is seen. the
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral
valve prolapse. no mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. there is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. there are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
 cxr
reason for examination: evaluation of the patient with
complicated pleural
effusion.

portable ap radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to .

there is interval increase in right pleural effusion, loculated,
better
appreciated on the prior radiograph but the change in size is
significant. no pneumothorax is seen. left pleural effusion is
unchanged. bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted.

discharge labs
.
micro.

blood culture, routine (preliminary):
      haemophilus influenzae, beta-lactamase negative.
         beta- lactamase negative: presumptively sensitive to
ampicillin. .
         beta-lactamase confirmation requested by dr. .

   aerobic bottle gram stain (final ):
      reported to and read back by dr.   on  at
0720.
      gram negative rod(s).


brief hospital course:
61 yo f with pmhx of htn presenting with sore throat, neck pain,
and odynophagia found to have epiglottis and retrophargyneal
phlegmon.
.
#epiglottis/retropharyngenal phlegmon: diagnosed on ct neck and
by ent scope. symptoms consistent with this. the patient did
improve clinically with steroids, ceftriaxone and clindamycin.
the patient's airway was closely monitored in the icu and
underwent repeat ent scoping on  that showed ongoing
arytenoid edema but completely patent airway. repeat ct neck and
chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck
pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous
lesion (see below), did not show lemierre's or mediastinitis.
there was minimal interval improvement in the phlegmon
collection, however. blood cultures from admission were positive
for gnrs, later grew out haemophilus influenzae. planned for 14
day course from day of first negative culture. the patient
remained hemodynamically stable and re-evaluation by ent in the
icu showed improved of supraglottic swelling so she was
transfered to the floor. repeat cultures were negative ???? hiv
was sent and was negative. patient continued to be symptom free
on the floor and did not have any further airway complaints or
problems. she was treated symptomatically with cepacol lozenges
and was kept on a nicotine patch and received nebulizers prn.
.
#erythematous lesion: patient developed a 3x3 inch erythematous
lesion on her anterior chest, 2 inches below cricoid and poorly
demarcated. the patient endorsed feeling warm and mildly tender
to palpation in this area with no pruritis. no
plaques/papules/bullae. the lesion was very blanching.
dermatology was consulted on  given spread of this
lesion to ~4x4 inches despite broadening to vancomycin. given
the timing of her antibiotics, this lesion was not felt due to
drug eruption, although a very early drug eruption can not be
ruled out. the erythema was felt most consistent with a toxic
exanthem, which is a vasodilation that occurs in patients with
bactermia (more often staph, strep). supportive care was
provided. derm followed patient while in house. by hospital day
4 the rash had significantly receeded. derm did not feel
compelled to biopsy - they thought it was likely due to her
infectious process but did not represent a cellulitis. her rash
improved later in her hospital course.
.
#pneumonia and pleural effusion: she was noted to have
intermittent hypoxemia and r sided pleuritic chest pain on .
medicine was consulted on , and in setting of new moderate
pleural effusions r>l on cxr, recommended chest ct, which showed
rapidly expanding and loculated effusion on r. she was then
transferred to medicine, and id was consulted. her antibiotics
were changed to ceftriaxone. her pleural effusion was attempted
to be drained by ir, but they only withdrew 30 cc of fluid,
given loculation. thoracic surgery was then involved and carried
out a vats procedure which was uncomplicated and the patient was
transferred back to medicine.
.
#hypertension: blood pressures normal and intermittently high
(sbps 150s) in-house. the patient's atenolol, lipitor were held
in the setting of epiglottis/retropharyngeal phlegmon but
restarted once she was able to tolerate pos. atenolol was
initially started at half home dose 50mg, then back to her full
dose.however due to asymp. bradycardia into the 40's atenolol
was discontinued ad replaced with chlorthalidone on .
.
# intermittent bradycardia to 40s, asymptomatic: she was
monitored on telemetry with occasional intermittent bradycardia
to the 40s. her ekg was otherwise normal, without avb. tte was
done which showed no hd significant pericardial effusion,
abscess, or vegetations. her bradycardia may have been due to
vagal tone in setting of pleural effusions and pleuritic pain.
.
# lower extremity edema: she noted increased edema during this
admission. she had some baseline edema as a flight attendant but
only while standing for long durations. she had no jvd or hjr,
and tte was normal.
.
#ppx: heparin sq
#full code, confirmed.

admission, he was febrile without an identified infectious
source and was thought to be from inflammatory response to
pancreatitis and peri-pancreatic fluid.  currently with
leukocytosis and left shift although no localizing signs of
infection.  the differential at this time includes (infected)
pancreatic pseudocyst, necrotizing pancreatitis and an
obstructed bile duct stent.

================================================================
surgery was then consulted and he went to the or on  for his
infected pancreatic necrosis, status post gallstone
pancreatitis. he had
1.  exploratory laparotomy.
2.  pancreatic debridement with wide drainage.
3.  open cholecystectomy.
4.  placement of a combined g/j tube (mic tube).

post-op he stayed in the icu for 2 nights and was trasnfered to
the floor on pod 3.

gi/abd: he was npo with a ngt and ivf. the ngt was removed on
pod 2. his g-tube was left to gravity drainage.
his j-tube was capped and then trophic tubefeedings were started
on pod 2. his tubefeedings were advanced to a goal of replete
with fiber 3/4 strength at 80cc/hr.
he had 3 jp drains in place and these were draining thick, dark
fluid.
he continued to have high output from these drains.
he was started on sips on pod 5, he was advanced to clears on
pod 6.
jp amylase was checked on pod 7, once on a full liquid diet. his
jp amylase was 27k, 34k, and 14k. he was made npo due to his jp
amylase reported as high. he continued on the tubefeedings. a
grape juice test was positive for a leak from around the jp
drains.
he had one small spot with minimal drainage that could be
expressed from his incision.
his is now having drainage around all his drains and g/j tube
with mild skin irritation. he has irritation around the tube
extending out from ~0.5 - 3 cm and appears at  to develop
yeast. his midline incision is c/i but has a small amount of
serous drainage on the gauze.

have suggested using criticaid anti fungal moisture barrier to
protect his skin from the drainage and to prevent the formation
of yeast. continue to apply a thin layer of dressing around the
drains and change as needed do not allow the gauze to become
saturated with drainage. apply the antifungal criticaid two to
three times/day.


a ct was obtained on  and showed:
1. heterogeneity in the region of the pancreas consistent with
the patient's previous necrotizing pancreatitis.
2. three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in
the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization
from the small bowel into this residual collection.
3. loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring
16 cm.
4. gastrojejunostomy in situ.
5. renal cysts.
6. bilateral pleural effusions.
7. enlarged prostate at 8 cm.
.
he will remain npo with tf for 2 weeks and then return for a
repeat ct. his drains will remain and the drainage will be
monitored.

pain: he had good pain control with a pca. he continued on a pca
thru pod 6. once back on a diet, he was ordered for po pain meds
with good control.

labs: we monitored his labs and his tbili decreased from a high
of 2.6 on pod 2 to wnl by .

cards: he was being followed by his pcp/cardiologist. he was put
back on his home meds on pod5, including lasix iv for gentle
diuresis and his heart meds.

renal: he was diuresing well and continued to have negative
fluid balance and losing weight appropriately.

chief complaint:
abdominal discomfort

major surgical or invasive procedure:
ercp x 2
endotracheal intubation

history of present illness:
the patient is an 85 year old woman with pmh of esrd on hd, htn,
and dm, who presented to the  ed on  with complaint of
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea x 3 days. the
patient also reported recent fever and chills.  in  the ed,
patient had a low grade temperature of 100.5 degrees.  her
abdomen was slightly distended, with no rigidity or rebound.
admission laboratory data were notable for wbc 6.2, elevated
transaminases, and inr 3.7.  right upper quadrant ultrasound
disclosed a 5 mm gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder.
there was also a 5mm  gallstone in the common bile duct, without
ductal dilatation.  the patient was evaluated by surgery for her
choledocholithiasis.  the patient was also seen by the ercp
fellow.  the patient was not acutely ill last night, so she was
admitted to the medicine team, with plan for ercp today. she was
kept npo and was administered ivf overnight.
  this morning, she was administered 4 u ffp to reverse her inr.
 after receiving 2 u ffp, she became hypoxic, with o2 sats
dropping to the 70s.  she was placed on 100% nrb with
improvement in her o2 sats to the 90s. prior to dialysis, she
was given 100 mg iv lasix, with urine output (non measured).  at
 pm, she was transferred to the hemodialysis unit for
initiation of hemodialysis.  approximately 1 l was removed, yet
the patient remained in respiratory distress, with o2 sats in
the low 90s on nrb.  at  pm, a respiratory code was called
since patient's o2 sats dropped to 70s on the nrb.  the patient
was emergently intubated.  abg prior to intubation was
7.21/55/55.  ekg disclosed new st segment depressions in the
inferior and lateral leads.  following intubation, the patient's
sbp dropped to 80s.  she was administered approximately 500 cc
ns bolus, and required dopamine transiently.  the patient was
transferred to the micu for further management.

brief hospital course:
1. respiratory failure: on hd#2, the patient developed acute
respiratory distress.  the patient had recieved ivf in the ed
the nigtht before and that monring had recieved 4 units of ffp
for planned ercp, the last two within one hour of respiratory
distress.  cxr demonstrated acute developement of bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates.  ddx included cardiogenic pulmonary edema
versus trali.  the patient was taken for emergent hd; however,
depspite succesful diuresis, the patient required intubation for
respiratory failure.  trali work-up is pending at the time of
discharge.  the patient remained intubated in the micu and
succesfully extubated on the second attempt.

2. hypotension: after intubation, the patient became hypotensive
in the micu requiring initiation of pressors.  she was found to
be adrenally insufficent by cortisyn stimulation test and
started on stress-dose hydrocortisone and fludircortisone.  in
addition, she required pressors and continued iv unasyn for
possible sepsis, though blood cultures were negative.  the
patient's blood pressure improved and stablized.

3. choledocholithasis: demonstrated on admission ruq us on
admission without transaminitis but with low-grade fever and
left-shift.  the patient was evaluted by surgery and ercp
service.  she was started on iv unasyn.  patient underwent ercp
in micu while intubated, which demonstrated dilated cbd but no
stones.  patient had spinchterotomy.  the patient completed a 10
day course of iv unsyn and will be discharged on two days.
consideration should be given to possible outpatient
cholecystetomy.

4. gi bleed: post-ercp, the patient dropped hct and was foudn to
be guiac postitive.  patient underwent repeat ercp which
demonstrated spincterotomy bleed.  this required epiniephrine
injection.  hct remained relatively stable, though she had a
possible rebleed several days later which stablized without
repeat scope.  asa and coumadin were held  bleed and may be
safely restarted on .  the patient's hct remained stable
for the rest of her hospital course.  the patient will continue
on her ppi.

5. coronary artery disease: during the patient's micu stay, ekg
was noted to have
poor r wave progression.  an echocardiogram was obtained which
demonstrated regional lv dysfunction suggesting cad.  cardiac
enzymes demonstrated non-diagnostic elevated tropnin t, felt
either secondary to demand or esrd.  asa was held  gi bleed
and the patient's beta-blocker was continued.  the patient will
need an outpatient evaluation of her coronaries, likely with ett
mibi when she is stable.  again, asa will be started .

6. esrd: the patient did well on her hemodilyasis schedule.  the
patient's prednisone was continued for her history of renal
vascultitis.

history of present illness:
a  year-old female with past medical history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, wegener's granulomatosis, recent
admission  for acute on chronic renal failure
with decision to initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital
stay complicated by left lower lobe moraxella pneumonia
presenting with altered mental status.  per her daughter, the
patient was home this past week and accidentally took trazodone
50 mg two days prior to admission, which had been discontinued
due to confusion.  her confusion/visual hallucinations improved
the day prior to admission.  she complained of increased
productive cough and oxygen requirement (previously intermittent
2l nc, now continuous) over the past two days, responding to an
increase in nebulizer treatments.  the patient was noted to be
lethargic this afternoon, responsive to sternal rub.  when
aroused, she was oriented x 3 and moving all extremities well,
however.  the patient was noted to be cold.  she has not
complained of recent fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema around line.

brief hospital course:
mrs.  is a  yo f with past medical history of copd,
wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease,
recent admission  for acute on chronic renal
failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower
lobe moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella
pneumonia and sepsis.

1)moraxella pneumonia: most likely explanation for respiratory
failure/hypotension in ed requiring intubation.  she was
successfully extubated on  and maintaining o2 sats on o2
via nc without e/o respiratory distress.  her sputum culture
from  is again growing moraxella, no other new
organisms.  cxr continues to show same lll infiltrate concerning
for partially treated pneumonia.  concerning for endobronchial
lesion with postobstructive pneumonia however chest ct did not
show any underlying structural cause for recurrance of
pneumonia.  she did have bilateral pleural effusions which
appeared simple and did not appear to be parapneumonic.  she was
initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn however this was
changed to ceftriaxone once culture data returned with
moraxella.  she improved daily from a repiratory standpoint and
was on minimal to no oxygen on discharge.  she was changed to
cefpodoxime on discharge to be given only on hemodialysis days,
after dialysis as this antibiotic is renally cleared.

2)altered mental status: likely delirium in the setting of
infection, sedating meds, icu stay especially in setting of
advanced age.  in addition, daughter reports that she took
trazodone two days prior to admission, which has caused
confusion in the past.  she had a ct head on admission without
acute process.  her mental status cleared during her hospital
stay and treatment of pneumonia.

3)coagulopathy: her inr was 2 on admission, however climbed to
peak of 5.3 likley due to poor nutrition and antibiotics.  her
coumadin was stopped  and held throughout the remainder of
her admission.  she was restarted on 1mg coumdain on discharge
with inr checks with dialysis. her inr was 2.9 on the day of
discharge.

4)chronic renal failure: secondary to anca vasculitis. decision
made to initiate hd last admission.  she was dialysed for volume
overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for
dialysis at fmc - west suburban dialysis center.  she was
continued on epogen with dialysis, nephrocaps, calcitriol,
calcium.

5)anemia: baseline mid-20s as of most recent  admission;
prior to that was in the low 30s. no signs or symptoms of active
bleeding, guaiac negative.   she was transfused one unit prbc
with dialysis on  with stable hematocrit around 26
throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.  she should be
continued on epogen with dialysis.

6)diarrhea - patient has developed diarrhea in setting of
multiple admissions and antibiotics.  she had one stool that was
negative for c. diff and was started on loperamide to decrease
stool output given skin breakdown.  she was also advised to eat
yogurt three times daily.  diarrhea is most likely antibiotic
associated due to alteration of normal bowel flora, however she
will require two additional stool samples to rule out c.diff.
she will require monitoring of in's and out's and encouragement
for oral intake to prevent dehydration.

7)skin breakdown: during her admission she began developing skin
breakdown on her gluteal cleft likely due to a combination of
immobility due to acute illness and diarrhea as discussed above.
 she will require close monitoring of her skin and frequent
personal care to keep her buttocks clean and protected.

8)paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  her metoprolol was initially
held in the icu given sinus bradycardia and sepsis.  it was
resumed at home dose on  however given borderline blood
pressures, it was decreased to 75mg  on .

9) spiculated lesion on ct chest: as discussed in radiology
report, will need repeat ct in 3 months to reassess this lesion
for stability.

discharge instructions:
you were admitted to the hospital with confusion, low blood
pressure and low oxygen most likely due to a serious pneumonia.
you were intubated and sent to the icu for care.  you improved
and were able to be extubated the following day.  you were
treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and your breathing
improved.  you had blood cultures, urine cultures and stool
cultures which did not show any evidence of infection.

you had dialysis with fluid removal as you were given a large
amount of iv fluids on admission for your infection which caused
swelling in your arms and fluid around your lungs.

you developed diarrhea during your admission which is most
likely due to antibiotics.  you were started on loperamide to
attempt to decrease the diarrhea and to prevent further skin
breakdown.

medications:
1)you will be discharged on cefpodoxime to complete a 2 week
course of antibiotics.  this should be taken only on dialysis
days, after your dialysis.
2)you can take loperamide as needed to decrease your diarrhea.
3)your coumadin was held during your admission but can be
restarted on discharge as your inr was down to 2.9.
4)your metoprolol was decreased to 75mg twice daily as your
blood pressure was borderline low.
no other changes were made to your medications.

medications. he was seen by dr.  and advisement was
made for him to undergo a below the knee amputation. the
patient accepted the recommendation. transplant nephrology
was consulted to follow the patient during his
hospitalization.  was consulted for hyperglycemic
management. daily sk5 levels were obtained. he required
minimal adjustment in his immunosuppression. he continued on
his lantus with a humalog sliding scale with improvement in
his glycemic control. on , he underwent a
right bka without incident. he was transferred to the pacu in
stable condition. at the end of his surgical procedure
intraoperatively, the patient became hypotensive with
systolic blood pressure in the 60s and he was given neo 200
mcg x2 and epinephrine 5 mg x2. the patient went into a
monomorphic vt 4 minutes at a rate of 130. he was given
lidocaine 100 mg iv bolus and amiodarone 125 mg over 15
minutes. the patient converted to sinus rhythm. an
intraoperative tee showed severe biventricular failure.

the patient continued on heparin, was extubated and
transferred to the vicu for continued monitoring and care on
. cardiology was requested to see the
patient on , who felt the patient was
hemodynamically stable and his atrial fibrillation was rate
controlled. we should continue the heparin while his inr is
less than 2 and his goal inr should be , and recommend
metoprolol tartrate twice a day versus single dosing. they
recommended aspirin 81 mg and simvastatin 20 mg daily.

blood transfusion

history of present illness:
mr.  is a 66-year-old male with hx hiv on haart,
lymphoma, lul lung adenocarcinoma s/p resection, hx cad s/p pci
with des in  to proximal circumflex artery. in  he had
elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of
previously placed stent, treated with overlapping cyper stent.
mid-rca was 80% occluded and treated with des as well. in 
pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass
graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft. his plavix
was discontinued at that time. he was recently admitted on
 w/ stemi over iii, f, taken to cath, where he had a des
placed in the lcx for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus
proximally. of note, at cath , he had a totally occluded
right external iliac artery. the pt was discharged home .
since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the
exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery,
bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night. he stated
he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he
developed a cold rough feeling in his esophagus similar to his
pain that he had with all of his prior mis. he states it was a
 in severity. he took 1 nitro, and it resolved. he reports
he did not take his plavix yesterday and today. he noted
intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which
felt like gas pain, + sob, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no
vomiting. he states the feeling returned and then persisted,
took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a . he
called 911.
.
in the ambulance, the pt's pain decr to  and he received
asa, another nitro en route. his pain, however, only resolved
completely on nitro gtt at osh where he was given asa, iv
integrillin, iv heparin, started on nitro drip with full
resolution of pain, transferred to  for emergent cath. his
initial bp at osh 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro. outside
labs with ck 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, bnp
17.
.
at , he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath. in the
cath lab: lcx was totally occluded within proximal stents. a
wire was passed and flow was reestablished (likely development
of blood clots). 1 additional bare metal stent (no des since he
had questionable compliance w/ plavix) placed distal to last
stent. some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches. cath
was performed via radial artery (per lower ext arterial
disease). his right groin (femoral vein) developed a hematoma.
his left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post
surgery 2 months ago. he was subsequently transferred to the
floor. he then had bp drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm hct was found
to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath hct). he is being
transferred to the ccu for unstable hct and hematoma with labile
bp s/p catheterization today.

brief hospital course:
66 year old male with hiv, cad, recently admitted for stemi
found to have 100% lcx lesion and stented w/ des, who presented
with stemi to osh, and found to have total occlusion of proximal
lcx stent, now s/p bare metal stent placement. pt was then found
to have a hematocrit drop and hypotension necessitating
transfuse to ccu, now stabilized.
.
blood loss: pt was s/p catheterization with r wrist for arterial
access and r groin for venous access. ct scan was performed, and
ruled out rp bleed and u/s ruled out av fistula and
pseudoaneurysm. he received a total of 3 units prbcs in ccu, and
his hct has been stable. pt likely had blood loss during cath,
and in groin hematoma. after being transferred back to the floor
from the ccu, his hct was stable. low-dose metoprolol was
started the night before discharge, and he tolerated this with
sbp in the 100s to 110s.
.
cardiac. patient was admitted with a repeat stemi secondary to
instent thrombosis. he had placement of a bare metal stent, and
was started on higher doses of plavix at 150 mg daily. he was
continued on aspirin and a high dose statin as well. his
antihypertensives were held due to hypotension, and restarted
prior to discharge.
he was not diuresed further, despite an elevated pcwp of 28 at
catheterization, due to hypotension. he remained in normal sinus
rhythm.
.
hyperbilirubinemia: the pt was noted to have mild jaundice and
scleral icterus on . lfts were checked and his total
bilirubin was 6.6, direct bili was 0.2. his other lfts were
normal. his hemolysis labs were normal. the hyperbilirubinemia
was felt to be most likely due to either reabsorption of the
large hematoma or a side effect from one of his hiv meds, most
likely atazanavir. his bilirubin continued to climb but he was
otherwise asymptomatic. a ruq u/s showed small gallstones but no
evidence of cholecystitis or obstruction. his statin and hiv
meds were stopped on discharge.

major surgical or invasive procedure:
none

history of present illness:
f russian-speaking h/o refractory nodular sclerosing hodgkins
lymphoma was brought in by ems and admitted after her home
health care aide noted she was hypotensive to 88/40 and
confused.

in the ed, t 98.4 (rectal), hr 101, bp 102/53, rr 20, o2sat 98%
on 3l. incontinant of guaiac-positive stool.  treated with 4 l
ns, vanco 1g iv, ceftazadime 1g iv, and flagyl 500mg iv.
received 0.5 mg ativan and 2mg iv morphine for agitation.

pt was admitted to  where she completed a 10-day course of
ceftazadime and vancomycin for urosepsis. a 7-day course of
metronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of c.
diff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated wbc count,
although all c. diff assays were negative. pt was stabilized and
was transferred to the floor for further care. at the time of
transfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,
thrombocytopenia and anemia.

on the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new afib
with rvr to 160s and hypotension to sbp 90-100s, as well as
respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.
there was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she
had pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; ep curbside, however, felt
digoxin was not recommended.

pt was therefore readmitted to the micu.  while in the micu, she
was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam as she had
sites of possible infection at the erosions under her
breasts and on her right hip, as well as question of pna, 
rising wbc, reaching a high of nearly 17.  micu course was also
marked by hypotension, which responded to gentle ns boluses;
low uop believed to be  both hypovolemia and a low
baseline nitrogenous load/obligate urine output; and 
recurrent afib, for which she was transitioned to amiodarone
400mg po daily, to run for 7 days before titrating downward.

clinical and echocardiographic data.

compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of , there is no definite change.

brief hospital course:
f with nodular sclerosing hodgkin's lymphoma initially
admitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the icu with
hypotension and afib with rvr.

# goals of care: the patient had a long hospital course with
many family meetings reagarding goals of care.  on  the
patient was made dnr/dni but the family continued to want icu
transfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the
patient.  the patient was tranferred to the unit on .
she was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a
decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.
 care was not escalated and she expired at  on .
the family declined autopsy.

# afib with rvr: pt experienced transient episodes of afib to
150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous
conversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses
and bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  digoxin
considered unfavorable in this patient.  in the micu, pt was
started on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone po.  when
the patient was readmitted to the icu on , she was having
increased pauses up to 20 seconds.  her amiodarone was stopped.


# thrombocytopenia/anemia: the patient was anemia and
thrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be
secondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. was transfused
total of 3 units plt (1 unit each on  and )
with a transfusion threshold of 10. will continue to trend
platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.
transfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on .  also, the
patient has been receiving prbc transfusions for hct <24 (total
of four units since ).

# hypotension: early on in the admission, she was having
hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to
fluid blosues of 250 cc.  echo demonstrated impaired lv
relaxation and given elevated wbc, there was concern for
distributive shock.  once no longer fluid responsive, she was
started on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  she was
again hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary
to systemic vasodilation.  she was started on levophed but a
decision was then made to not escalate care.

# infection: wbc elevated with multiple possible infectious
sources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions
under breasts, course breath sounds with ?pna).  vanc and piptaz
started on ; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not
obtainable at this point.  cdiff repeated with toxin b. c diff
neg, thus d/c flagyl .  now with gnr from skin swab.

# hypernatremia: noted to be periodically hypernatremic since
admission (na 148-150), due to free water defecit. she has been
getting slow infusions of d5w as she has poor po intake and have
not been able to keep up her free water intake.

# altered mental status: increased lethargy compared to baseline
on admission most likely  metabolic encephalopathy due to
infection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after
resolution of urosepsis. head ct negative for acute process.
thyroid studies show elevated tsh but this may be c/w sick
euthyroid syndrome.

# respiratory distress: early in her admission, the patient
developed labored breathing after receiving 1 l ns for
hypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  diuresis with furosemide
gtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated
respiratory distress.  on  she was on the floor and had a
witnessed aspiration event and needed 100% hi flow mask.  while
in the icu her o2 was weaned but again aspirated and had
increasing o2 requirements.

# acute renal failure: pt noted to have cr up to 1.7 on
admission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of
0.9. likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due
to sepsis.  later in her hospital course, the patient was
hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought
secondary to atn.

# hypothyroidism:  initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg
iv daily (half home dose).  t3 low. tsh elevated.  resumed home
dose 1/4.

# anasarca: pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural
effusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low
albumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.
diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed
above.  continue to monitor.

# urosepsis: admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis
requiring pressor support. urine cultures from  were
positive for e.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin
and ceftazidime x10 days.  repeat ucx  grew out yeast,
which was not treated.  another repeat ucx  final again grew
out yeast.

# right hip pain: pain due to destruction of the right
acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on ct scan.
there is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head

agressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and
hypoalbuminemia.  was difficult to effect a significant diurese

heart rate 76 to 79.  blood pressure 90/50.  respirations 15.
sat 94 to 99% on 2 liters.  in general, well appearing and in
no acute distress.  pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  no scleral icterus.  oropharynx is clear.
conjunctiva were slightly pale.  no lymphadenopathy.  no
bruits.  jvp approximately 8 cm.  chest rales at the right
base.  cardiac regular.  s1 and s2.  no murmurs.  abdomen was
benign, soft, nontender.  good bowel sounds.  he had a
midline ventral hernia, which was soft. liver was palpated 2
cm below the costal margin.  the patient was ob positive in
the emergency department.  extremities revealed 1+ pedal
edema with venostasis changes bilaterally.  skin examination
had no rashes.  the patient s alert and oriented times three
with a chronic left foot drop.

initial laboratories:  white blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit
31.4, which then dropped to 24.3, baseline is 41.  platelets
138.  sma 7 notable for a sodium of 136, k of 4.7, bicarb 24,
bun 32, creatinine 0.5, glucose 158, inr 2.3.  dilantin level
was 3.0.  alt 35, ast 51, alkaline phosphatase 203.  total
bilirubin .5, ldh 215, albumin 3.0.  enzymes were cycled,
which were negative.  the patient's electrocardiogram
revealed normal sinus rhythm, pr prolongation at 206.  left
axis deviation, inferior qs, all of which were old.   there
were some new t wave flattening in v2 to v6.

hospital course:  1.  gastrointestinal bleed:  the patient
was admitted with melena likely an upper gastrointestinal
bleed given history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, question of
enteric fistula.  given history of hemochromatosis and early
cirrhosis, question of varices, given history of reflux
symptoms, question of esophagitis, gastritis.  the patient
was again admitted with gastrointestinal bleed and was typed
and crossed.  he was initially transfused 2 units for a
hematocrit of 24.  he had two peripheral intravenouses in
place.  inr was corrected with vitamin k 2 mg and 4 units of
fresh frozen platelets and hematocrit revealed a change from
24 up to 26 after 4 units.  inr corrected to 1.7.  the
patient  was also started on protonix 40 intravenous b.i.d.
aspirin and coumadin  were held.  the patient underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the following morning, which
revealed grade 1 esophageal varices and mild gastritis
esophagitis as well as portal gastropathy.  there was no
active bleeding at any site.  the patient then underwent an
abdominal ct, which was negative for aortic enteric fistula.
on the following day the patient underwent a colonoscopy,
which was normal up until the ascending colon.  however, they
were not able to go all the way to the cecum and recommended
virtual colonoscopy in the future and the patient had then
underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding
times four to the esophageal varices.  the patient will need
a repeat banding procedure in ten days.  after the banding
the patient was started on sucralfate 1 gram q.i.d. and was
continued on protonix.  again aspirin and coumadin were held
throughout.  after 4 units hematocrit stabilized from 24 up
to 32 and remained stable at 32 upon discharge.

2.  hypotension:  the patient was initially in the systolics
in the 90s likely hypovolemic in the setting of a
gastrointestinal bleed.  however, given the history of
cardiac disease the patient's enzymes were cycled times
three, which were negative.  he was resuscitated with fluid,
fresh frozen platelets and packed red cells and blood
pressure remained stable throughout.  after the
esophagogastroduodenoscopy the atenolol was switched to
nadolol given the history of cirrhosis and varices and
zestril was held up until discharge due to low blood
pressures.

3.  coronary artery disease:  patient with a history of
myocardial infarction in  and  and is status post
stent of the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
in .  enzymes were cycled, which were negative.  aspirin
and coumadin were held due to gastrointestinal bleed.  beta
blocker and ace were initially held due to low blood
pressures.  lipitor was held secondary to new cirrhosis.  the
patient was restarted on nadolol upon discharge, however,
aspirin, coumadin, zestril and lipitor were held prior to
discharge to be restarted by primary care physician at his or
her discretion.

4.  deep venous thrombosis:  patient with recurrent left
lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, but admitted with
gastrointestinal bleed.  inr 2.3, coumadin was held due to
multiple procedures and held upon discharge.  the patient
will undergo repeat banding in ten days after which time the
patient may or may not resume anticoagulation per primary
care physician.

5.  hemachromatosis:  the patient with hemachromatosis for
long standing, now with evidence of cirrhosis on examination.
the patient will continue with further phlebotomies as per
dr.  and may need further workup for cirrhosis.

6.  history of abdominal aortic aneurysm:  patient ruled out
enteric fistula with negative abdominal ct.

7.  seizure disorder:  the patient was given additional dose
of dilantin 400 times one and then restarted on his regular
does of 300 and will continue on his regular dose.  no
further seizure activity.

8.  diabetes:  the patient was initially held npo diabetic
medications due to npo status.  was covered with a sliding
scale.  sugars remained stable and can restart glyburide upon
discharge.  metformin held secondary to cirrhosis.

discharge diagnoses:
1.  esophageal varices s/p banding.
2.  portal gastropathy.
3.  gastritis esophagitis.
4.  hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis.
5.  coronary disease.
6.  recurrent deep venous thrombosis.
7.  congestive heart failure.
8.  diabetes.
9.  s/p abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
10.  seizure disorder.

medications on discharge:
1.  nadolol 20 q.d.
2.  sucralfate one q.i.d. times seven days.
3.  protonix 40 po q.d.
4.  dilantin 300.

history of present illness:  the patient was a 73-year-old
female admitted to the ccu on  with hyperkalemia and
bradycardia.  the patient had a past medical history
significant for hypertension, glaucoma, and breast cancer
treated with lumpectomy, xrt in .  she was in her usual
state of health until  when she began to note shortness
of breath.  she saw her pcp and performed  chest x-ray,
which revealed a right upper lobe density.  this was followed
up with a ct scan, which revealed a lobulated mass of 2.3 cm
in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe and
bilateral lobe interstitial fibrosis.  follow-up pet scan was
nondiagnostic.  the patient had a mediastinoscopy, which
showed no evidence of malignancy or lymph nodes.  lung biopsy
was performed, which revealed pulmonary fibrosis.  subsequent
spirometry revealed a mild restrictive defect.  the entire
picture was thought to represent uip.

on , she presented to the 
  with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea times several days.  in the waiting room, she
developed presyncope.  she was urgently brought to the trauma
bay, there her heart rate was in the 30s with the ekg
revealing a junctional rhythm.  her sbp was in the 80s.
attempts made to place a temporary pacing wire but during the
procedure the patient suffered respiratory arrest.  she was
intubated and resuscitated, and a line was successfully
placed.  subsequent labs revealed a potassium of 9.8.  the
patient was treated with calcium bicarb, insulin, and glucose
and admitted to ccu.

in the ccu, the patient was started on levophed and dopamine
for hypotension.  swan-ganz catheter was placed to evaluate
her hypotension and revealed an svr of 2473 with a cardiac
output of 2.2.  two hours later, the cardiac output was 6.5
and svr was 898 after pressors were weaned down.  urgent tte
revealed normal systolic function, no pericardial effusion.
potassium dropped to 4.3 after 1 day.  the patient was
empirically treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl
for hypotension, which was thought possibly due to sepsis.
by hospital day 3, she was off pressors, her white blood
count was 16.1.  she was successfully extubated, and her
potassium remained normal.  by hospital day 4, she continued
to have mild respiratory distress despite being extubated.
she was thought to be in mild chf.  she was diuresed.
levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued for possible
pneumonia.  by hospital day 5, she developed worsening
respiratory distress, and the patient agreed to elective
intubation.  she was then transferred to the micu for further
workup and care.

past medical history:  hypertension.

glaucoma.

breast cancer.

uip.

allergies:  no known drug allergies.

medications on admission:
1. verapamil.

3. tamoxifen.
4. xalatan eye drops.
5. betoptic eye drops.
6. calcium carbonate.
7. aspirin.
8. folate.
9. vitamin e.


physical examination:  on admission to the micu, temperature
98.9 degrees, blood pressure 126/61, and pulse 108.  the
patient was sedated and intubated.  her lungs revealed
diffuse crackles bilaterally.  cardiac exam was within normal
limits.  abdomen was benign.  lower extremity revealed no
edema.

pertinent laboratory data:  on admission to the micu included
a white count of 21.9, hematocrit of 29.3, and  platelets of
85.

chest x-ray on admission to micu revealed persistent
bilateral upper lobe patchy opacities, may represent
interstitial edema plus aspiration.  continued patchy
atelectasis within the left lower lobe and small left pleural
effusion.

concise summary of hospital course:  the patient was admitted
to the medical intensive care unit with presumed diagnosis of
sepsis.  subsequently, she developed a picture consistent
with ards and required multiple pressors.  after several days
in the ccu, she was on 3 different pressors and was unable to
maintain her blood pressure.  she was requiring increasing
ventilatory support.  a discussion was held with the family
who decided that the patient will be made dni/dnr due to the
fact that cpr was likely to be unhelpful if the patient
arrested.  on  at  p.m., the patient was
pronounced dead.  the family was at the bedside.

imaging:
 ekg: sinus tachycardia. right bundle-branch block. no
previous tracing available for comparison.

 cxr:
single frontal portable view of the chest: as compared to prior
study there is minimal increase in right mid - lower lung
opacity . right lower lobe pleural thickening is grossly stable.
bullous changes denoted by relative lucency in the right upper
lobe are again noted and unchanged. prominent right mediastinal
- paratracheal soft tissue remains unchanged. left lung is
clear. heart is not enlarged. the aortic contour is grossly
unremarkable.

impression: minimal interval increase in opacification of the
right mid -
lower lung is better evaluated on subsequent ct from same day.

 cta chest:
1. no pulmonary embolus.
2. right lung volume loss could be due to a congenital anomaly
or pulmonary infection early in life.
3. persistent area of round atelectasis in the right lower lobe
with
increased size slightly since .
4. new subpleural septal thickening in the left upper lobe and
medial basal left lower lobe, new since  and suggestive of
an interstitial fibrosis.
5. mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node.

given the pulmonary interstitial findings and mildly enlarged
lymph node,
followup high-resolution ct is suggested, preferrably in 3
months if not
needed earlier.

 transthoracic echocardiogram:
the left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. the
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global
systolic function (lvef>55%). due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. the right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. there is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. the aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). there is no aortic valve stenosis. no
aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. there is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is no
pericardial effusion.

impression: suboptimal image quality. right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
function.
this constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process, e.g., pulmonary embolism.

brief hospital course:
in the ed, initial vs were: t: 99.5 p109 bp101/56 r24 79% on ra
on presentation, 100% on nrb. labs notable for wbc of 5, hct
34.5, sodium of 131 and creatinine of 1.0. patient was given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, nebs, and methylprednisone.  he
had a cxr which was possibly suggestive of rml pneumonia, and a
cta that showed no signs of pe but did reveal some increased
interstitial markings in the rul and rll, more consistent with a
chronic process vs. pneumonia. the patient was admitted to the
icu for monitoring on . he had in past refused cpap for his
osa but accepted it and reported he had an unusually restful
night. he was transferred to the medicine floor on .

#  hypoxia: his increased cough and the ct and chest xray
imaging were most consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia
with underlying chronic pneumonic process, and he will need
another high-resolution chest ct in 3 months to evaluate
progression of these findings. in the icu, he continued
antibiotic treatment for cap. he did not receive further
steroids. he had an echo that showed rv enlargement, free wall
hypokinesis & moderate elevation of pasp. although these
findings were consistent with possible pulmonary embolism, he
had a cta on admission that was negative for pe. pulmonary was
consulted and felt his right heart findings could be related to
his underlying known chronic lung disease and sleep apnea rather
than pe. after discussion with his pcp and pulmonologist, he was
discharged to have a repeat sleep study performed and follow-up
tte in 1 month.  patient was encouraged to start using home
cpap.

# hyponatremia: he was noted to be mildly hyponatremic at
admission, possibly due to salt-wasting from his hctz use. this
mild hyponatremia resolved with a liter of normal saline.

# obstructive sleep apnea: he is now agreeable to trialing cpap.
he was told he should have an outpatient sleep study as above.

# normocytic anemia: his hematocrit was slightly lower than
recent baseline, and iron studies were consistent with chronic
inflammation.  this will be further worked up as an outpatient.

discharge instructions:
you came to the hospital with shortness of breath and fatigue.
you were briefly in the intensive care unit for close monitoring
and your breathing improved with antibiotics and steroids.  you
were found to have pneumonia and are being treated with
antibiotics.  you had an echocardiogram of your heart that
showed some strain on the right side of your heart, and this is
likely due to your lung disease.  please follow-up with your pcp
.  and your pulmonologist dr.  as below.  you have
also been scheduled to see dr.  in sleep medicine to
discuss your sleep apnea.

the following changes were made to your medications:
started levofloxacin, an antibiotic, once daily.  you should
take this for 4 more days.

followup instructions:
please follow-up with your pcp, . , on  at   you
should have another echocardiogram done in 1 month to evaluate
your heart function.

you have an appointment to see dr. , a sleep physician, 
 at 8 am,  building  to discuss your
sleep apnea. you should be fitted for a cpap machine at home to
treat your obstructive sleep apnea.  if you need to reschedule,
you can call .

please follow-up with pulmonary (dr.  on  at
 am on the  of the  building, .  if an earlier appointment is available, they will contact
you.  if you need to reschedule your appointment, please call

history of present illness:
* interview conducted with the aid of ms.  daughter
.
history of present illness: ms.  is an 86 y/o f with
history of nephrotic cri, renal artery stenosis, and chf, who
presented with hypertensive emergency and heart failure. the
patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until
3 days prior to admission. at that time, her bp was 220 systolic
@ home and she noticed mild sob. on the night prior to
admission, she developed increasing sob. per the patient's
daughter, she had been taking her medications as prescribed. she
denies chest pain throughout this time. she was brought in by
daughter to  for evaluation and was found to have bp 202/40
with a k of 5.9. she was treated with kayexalate 30, lasix 40
iv, clonidine 0.3 mg po x 1, and levoflox 750 mg iv x 1.
.
the patient was initially admitted to the floor, where she was
found to have the following vitals: 98.3 226/68 68 90% 5lnc (mid
80s on 2lnc), 96% on face tent, rr > 40. as she was acutely
dyspneic and in acute failure, she was given 100mg iv lasix and
diuril (on the advice of renal consultants), w/ good effect->
uop 350cc in ~1hour. she did not receive any nitrates or
morphine at the time. on micu evaluation was 99% on shovel mask,
but still rr>40. appeared comfortable, jvp ~9 cm. at that time,
she denied ha, visual changes, cp, urinary changes, no abd pain,
n/v/d. in the micu, she was aggressively diuresed and placed on
her usual blood pressure regimen. overnight , she did
not receive all of her blood pressures meds as her bps were in
the 110s/120s overnight. she did receive all doses of clonidine
and hydralazine on .
.
her daughter tells me that her edema is less than usual, but
that her right leg is chronically larger than the left. she has
been using several pillows to sleep at home. she denies pnd. she
is not on supplemental o2 at home. generally bp at home is 170s
(per pcp 160s in office at baseline).
.
pt was diagnosed with w/ rll pna by her pcp and tx /
levofloxacin x 10 days about 4 weeks ago. since that time, the
daughter has been living with the pt x 3 weeks. her cough has
persisted per the daughter, but the patient did improve greatly
following antibiotics.

at the present time, the patient says she is comfortable. she
denies chest pain. she continues to make adequate urine.

pertinent results:
studies:
 cxr: impression: moderate congestive heart failure,
worse since the exam of one month ago.
.
 echo: tte conclusions:
the left atrium is moderately dilated. there is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (lvef 60%).
.
there is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
.
there is severe mitral annular calcification. there is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral
stenosis. mild to moderate (+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly underestimated.]
.
the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. the
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic.
.
there is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is
a small pericardial effusion.

compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of , borderline mitral stenosis is now evident.
the mitral regurgitation, which is almost certainly
underestimated on this study, is probably increased.
.
 cxr two views: comparison with the previous study done
. there is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary
edema. the mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. streaky
density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. there is a moderate right pleural effusion and
small left pleural effusion. an underlying right basilar
consolidation cannot be excluded. the heart and mediastinal
structures are unchanged.

brief hospital course:
ms.  is an 86 year old female with probable endstage
renal failure not on hd, who presented with hypertensive
emergency and congestive heart failure.  she was admitted to the
medical floor but immediately was sent to the micu for
respiratory distress. there she was agressively diuresed and
then returned to the medical floor.
.
* hypertensive emergency: her htn is likely secondary to her
esrd.  the elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema
and congestive heart failure.  she was given blood pressure
medications to help control her bp within the range of 130-160
as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion.
 her baseline bp is reportedly 160 at home.  ultimately she was
placed on clonidine 0.2 mg tid, hydralazine 100mg tid, norvasc
10mg qday, metoprolol 12.5mg tid, lasix 40mg .
.
* ? svt: during her initally presentation, she did have some
runs of svt noted on telemetry.  once she was diuresed no
further episodes were noted.  she was continued on metoprolol
12.5 mg tid for given episodes of ? svt.
.
* congestive heart failure: likely from worsening renal failure
and hypertensive urgency. she was agressively diuresed in the
micu with iv furosemide overnight and then with po furosemide on
the medical floor. she was also continued on hydralazine for
afterload reduction.
.
* renal failure: a renal consult was obtained.  they felt that
there was no acute needs for dialysis at present although they
have been discussing starting hd with the patient and her family
for a while now.  this discussion was continued throughout the
admission and the patient and her family were resistent to
starting.  they agreed to meet with dr.  in the next two
weeks to discuss getting a tunnelled cath and starting hd.
throughout admission, her electrolytes were monitored closely as
she had boughts of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis.
 these were controlled with standard measures.
.
* hyperkalemia: received kayexalate in ed. usually takes
kayexalate twice a week as outpatient, so this was restarted as
an inpatient.
.
* anemia: baseline hct appears to be 29-33 and now 25. iron 45,
ferritin 149, tibc 269 in . per renal recommendation, she
was transfused 1 unit prbc on  without complications.
.
* bacteremia: wbc count 10 on admission and down to 6.4 today.
has been afebrile but blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles with
staph coag negative- likely contaminant. before speciation
returned, she was treated with vancomycin dosed by level. once
it was found to be coag negative staph, the vancomycin was
discontinued. all subsequent surveillence cultures were
negative.

costophrenic angle is blunted consistent with pleural effusions.
 left lung base atelectasis are noted.  there is no evidence of
pneumothorax. there is a right lung base opacity obscuring the
right-side cardiac border which may represent right middle lobe
atelectasis vs. pneumonia. pprominence of the pulmonary
vasculature is noted, consistent with mild chf. the osseous

brief hospital course:
1. dyspnea - the patient's dyspnea was thought to be secondary
from volume overload, occuring in the context of esrd and a
missed hemodialysis session, as well as hypertension leading to
flash pulmonary edema. her dyspnea following hemodialysis.

2. hypertension - the patient's hypertension is also likely
related to volume overload. her blood pressures improved
following dialysis and resumption of her home course of toprol,
clonidine, amlodipine, and hydralazine.

had difficulty with shortness of breath. this shortness of
breath
would prevent him from sleeping comfortably. he describes
symptoms consistent with orthopnea and pnd. he notes that he saw
dr.  a couple of weeks ago and was started on lasix and

cxr :
semi-upright portable ap view of the chest obtained.
moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with diffuse ground-glass
haziness throughout the lungs compatible with pulmonary edema.
the right hemidiaphragm remains somewhat elevated and overall
low lung volumes are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation.
there are no large pleural effusions and no sign of
pneumothorax. hilar engorgement is compatible with congestive
heart failure.  bony structures appear intact.
impression: cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema.

lhc :
1) selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel cad. the lmca was normal
without any
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions. the stent in
the
proximal lad had diffuse 60% in-stent restenosis. there was 80%
stenosis
throuhgout the proximal lcx, with a 60-70% stenosis at the
origin of the
omb. the rca had a 100% proximal stenosis with prominent
left-to-right
collaterals.
2) resting hemodynamics showed elevated right and left-sided
filling
pressures with an rvedp of 17 mmhg and an lvedp of 27 mmhg. the
peak
gradient over the aortic valve was 14 mmhg. using the gorlin
equation,
the  was calculated to be 1.1 cm2, indicating moderate aortic

stenosis.
3) left ventriculography was deferred.

final diagnosis:
1. three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. moderate aortic stenosis.
3. atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
4. needs diuresis prior to cardioversion.
5. consideration for avr-cabg.

brief hospital course:
the patient underwent the usual preoperative work-up.  dental
examined the patient and recommended extraction of one tooth.
the patient refused.
the patient was brought to the operating room on  where
the patient underwent avr (tissue), cabg x 3, resection of left
atrial appendage with dr. .  overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
cvicu in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
he does have a history of heart failure with an ef of 30% and
initially required multiple inotropes and vasopressors.  he
remained intubated due to pulmonary congestion, which improved
with diuresis.  rapid a-fib developed and amiodarone drip was
initiated.  this was discontinued when rate was controlled.  he
failed a trial of precedex.  he self-extubated and was
re-intubated without incident.  he developed a leukocytosis and
was started on cipro for a positive urinalysis.  there was no
growth on culture, and cipro was discontinued.  tube feeds were
started on pod 3.  he was extubated on pod 4.  by this time, all
vasoactive drips had been weaned.  coumadin was resumed for
chronic a-fib.  chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  beta-blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the pre-operative weight.
ace inhibitor was not initiated due to a rise in creatinine,
which would start to trend down prior to discharge.  the patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  by the time of discharge on pod #10
the patient was ambulating freely, and pain was controlled with
oral analgesics. due to upper and lower pole serosanguinous
sternal drainage, mr. was placed on prophylactic
antibiotics x 1 week per dr..  the patient was discharged  to
 rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up

likely followed an indolent course, with her rapid atrial
fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction causing progressive
volume overload.  her acute exacerbation was likely due to
post-cardioversion pulmonary edema.  she initially had a
low-grade fever, but pneumonia was thought less likely, and her
chest x-ray was without infiltrate.  she had normal cardiac
enzymes, so ischemia was not a contributing factor.  she was
maintained on a beta blocker and ace-inhibitor.  after
aggressive diuresis, she was weaned off mechanical ventilation
quickly.  diuresis was continued with prn iv lasix, and she had
resolution of her dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
.
# atrial fibrillation: she was in sinus rhythm on admission, and
was initially maintained on propafenone and metoprolol.  on ,
she converted to atrial fibrillation and had a rapid ventricular
response in the 140s.  she underwent dc cardioversion, after
which she became hypotensive and bradycardic, requiring
transient treatment with dopamine.  she was continued on
propafenone after the dccv.  on the morning of , she
converted into atrial fibrillation again, with rates of 140s.
she had a normal blood pressure and some mild palpitations.  she
was initially loaded with po amiodarone, with slowing of her
heart rates to the 100s to 110s.  when her heart rate began to
trend up again, she was loaded with iv amiodarone and started on
a drip.  her rates remained in the 100s to 110s.  she was
transitioned to po amiodarone on the night of .  she
experienced nausea and vomiting on po amiodarone.  she underwent
another cardioversion on  but reverted back to atrial
fibrillation the next day.  she was continued on amiodarone but
remained in atrial fibrillation.  she went into rapid
ventricular response in the 150s on , requiring iv diltiazem
to bring her rate down.  she was started on po diltiazem, which
was quickly titrated up with her heart rate decreasing to the
80s.  the diltiazem was stopped the morning of , just before
she underwent another cardioversion.  she remained in sinus
rhythm for the rest of her stay.  she was discharged on
amiodarone 200mg po three times daily, with a follow up
appointment with dr. .  anticoagulation as below.
.
# elevated inr:  inr went from 4 on  to 9 on  with only
1 mg of coumadin.  last admission was for inr of 16 on coumadin
4mg qhs.  received 5mg vitamin k sc in the ed.  repeat coags on
the floor showed inr of 11, would have expected some decline
with sc vitamin k.  her inr decreased to 4.5 with ffp.  her inr
then decreased to normal.  hematology was consulted and felt she
could potentially have a partial clotting factor deficiency
causing her severe sensitivity to coumadin.  her coumadin was
held throughout most of her stay, and she was maintained on iv
heparin.  coumadin was restarted at 0.5mg on  after her
cardioversion.  her inr remained subtherapeutic after 2 doses.
she was discharged on coumadin 0.5mg qhs with a lovenox bridge,
with an inr check 4 days after discharge.  she is to follow up
with her pcp to consider hematology follow up.

brief hospital course:
85 year-old woman presents with cholangitis 
choledocholithiasis s/p ercp with biliary stent placement.
gallstone was not removed because of the patient's tenous
condition.  the plan will be to repeat the ercp in one month to
remove the stone.  patient was also with bacteremia with e. coli
and enterococcus likely  biliary source.  patient initially
on zosyn, but because of thrombocytopenia was changed over to
vanco and cipro.  this was finally changed to ampicillin when
susceptibilities resulted.

# cholangitis: ruq pain, fever, leukocytosis with bandemia, ast
979, alt 723, ap 120, tb 3.5 and direct of 2.4. ercp was
performed and a double pigtail plastic stent was placed. her
hemodynamics remained stable. blood cultures were positive for
gram negative rods, and she was treated with iv zosyn.
hepatitis serologies demonstrated previous hepatitis a exposure.
 she developed bacteremia (see below) and will continue
antibiotics until .  she will need ercp follow up in 1 month
for repeat ercp and stent placement.

# e. coli and enterococcus bacteremia both susceptible to
ampicillin.  pt initially on zosyn, then changed to vanco and
ciprofloxacin given thrombocytopenia.  id was consulted and did
not recommend cardiac imaging given that the likely source was
the biliary tree and surveillance cultures were negative.  she
was converted to ampicillin and should continue a 14 day course
since last negative culture ().

# shortness of breath likely  fluid overload: patient was
intermittently tachypneic and wheezing and was treated with
albuterol nebs and lasix with improvement.  echo ordered to
evaluate for systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  she was found
to have restrictive filling pressures and elevated  .
 she will be discharged on lasix 10mg daily until she sees her
pmd.  she will need cardiology follow up given her disease.

# thrombocytopenia: plts decreased to 83 () from 182 on
admission. pt not on heparin, thought to be  sepsis at
admission. hemolysis labs not concerning for dic, and less
likely thought to be due to itp or ttp. after discontinuation of
zosyn, the platelets increased and remained stable. on
discharge, her platelets were 252.

# hypertension: lisinopril restarted in icu. atenolol and
nifedipine restarted on the floor.  blood pressures were well
controlled on the floor.

history of present illness:
77 y/o f with pmhx of developmental delay, copd, hl, htn and
mirizzi syndrome who presented today for elective ercp.  pt was
felt to be functionning at baseline prior to procedure with mild
agitation, pulling at pivs but interacting with staff.  she was
given fent/midaz for ercp with stent placement and was
transferred to the post-ercp suite in stable condition. she had
elevated bps during the procedure requiring labetalol and
metoprolol. she was found mildly tachypneic/wheezing with emesis
on her gown. it was felt likely that she had an aspiration event
with low grade temp  however, she was still moving all four
extremities and responding appropriately to questions though
mildly sedated prior to transfer to the floor.
.
on arrival to the floor, pt was minimally responsive to sternal
rub and did not withdraw to focal stimuli.  she was notably
tachypneic and eyes were deviated to right side.  she was able
to track to left with stimuli and would intermittently open eyes
to command.   pt had an abg 7.4/36/92 with lactate of 3.5 and
cxr showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  due to concern for
acute intracranial hemmorrhage, she was taken down for a stat ct
head.  on return to the floor, pt was given narcan without any
significant change in mental status.  neuro was consulted for
possible acute stroke and within a few minutes, she became more
responsive, opening eyes spontaneously. by the time neuro came
to bedside, pt was able to verbalize her name and was noted to
be using the right arm and had left sided deficit.  a code
stroke was called and pt was taken for urgent cta head which did
not show any vessel obstruction and tpa was felt unlikely to be
helpful.  perfusion images confirmed right temporal
hypoperfusion consistent with clinical exam and likely right mca
infarct.  icu consult was initiated and pt's guardian was
notified.  pt was given vanc/cefepime and aspirin 300mg pr while
awaiting icu transfer.  she was lying flat per neuro recs and
was noted to be spitting up bilious emesis.  head of bed was
elevated and pt was suctionned prior to transferred to the icu
for closer monitoring of airway and management of acute
pneumonia.

brief hospital course:
77 y/o f with pmhx of developmental delay, copd, hl, htn and
mirizzi syndrome who presented on  for elective ercp. pt
was noted to have emesis on her gown in the post procedure suite
with diffuse wheezes and low grade temp. it was thought likely
that she had an aspiration event and when she was arrived on the
floor, she had a profoundly depressed mental status, tachypnea
and fever to 101.9.  further stat work up revealed evidence of
aspiration pna, leukocytosis and elevated lactate.  initial head
imaging was unrevealing. however, she became more alert and was
noted to have an acute left sided deficit. code stroke was
called and cta/perfusion images confirmed right sided
hypoperfusion likely consistent with right mca stroke.  neuro
felt there was no indication for tpa given patent intracranial
vessels and on return to the floor, pt was noted to have bilious
secretions that she was having difficulty clearing.  she was
transferred to the icu for airway monitoring overnight. pt was
called out to the floor when she was able to cough and spit up
secretions.  she was noted to have a waxing and  mental
status, sometimes will respond to commands and other times will
not.  bp was allowed to autoregulate for the first 72 hrs post
event and pt was continued on aspirin 300mg daily.  she was
noted to have recovery of left arm function and was answering
yes/no to questions.

she was seen by pt/ot who recommended ongoing therapy upon
return to nh.
after discussion with hcp/guardian, decision was made to avoid
follow up mri as it was not likely to change care plan and pt
was unlikely to tolerate the procedure.  echo was performed to
rule out cardioembolic source which did not show any thrombus.
lipid panel showed ldl in the 93, and hgb a1c 9.4.  she was
hyperglycemic during the hospitalization, and she was started on
lantus and sliding scale insulin.
.
aspiration pna: pt was noted to have aspiration event s/p
procedure and was monitored in the icu for 24hrs given concern
for her ability to protect airway .  leukocytosis, lactate and
fevers resolved after initiation of vanc/cefepime/flagyl.
respiratory status improved and pt had a picc placed and she
completed a course of antibiotics.

upper extremity dvt- patient was subsequently developed a dvt
associated with the picc line. the picc line was discontinued
and she was started on lovenox.  once a peg tube was placed, she
was started on warfarin for a goal inr of .  please follow
inr closely and titrate prn.  she received her first dose of
warfarin 5 mg on .

aspiration - pt was seen by speach/swallow on multiple
occasions, which she grossly failed with aspiration.  she was
kept strictly npo, and she was maintained with iv medications
and hydration.  a dobhoff was placed for initiation of tube
feeds, while waiting to see if she would regain her swallow
function.  it is/was hoped that her swallow function would
improve, especially considering her significant recovery in her
left arm movement, however, she did not show significant
improvement on serial exams.  in discussion with speech and
swallow, however, there is some hope that she may recover her
swallow on a long term basis, and swallow therapy may help with
this recovery.  they suggested an approximate 50% chance of
recovery to the point of safe oral intake in the long-term.

underwent stent and sphincteroplastyon  for recurrent abd
pain. she was noted to have an acute rise in transaminases post
procedure and these trended down with normal tbili.  pt was
followed by ercp team while in house.
.
developmental delay: baseline confirmed with her guardian/mother
and nursing home.
.
htn: held bp meds to allow autoregulation s/p stroke. she was
subsequently treated with iv metoprolol, clonidine patch, and iv
lasix, with benefit. after obtaining access via peg, a blood
pressure medication regimen via peg was begun. i expect that she
will benefit from further titration of medications as an
outpatient.  please note that she was also started on
lisinopril; please follow up lytes in 1 week to ensure she
tolerates.
.
hyperlipidemia: patient's simvastatin was held while patient was
npo. this was resumed after obtaining access via peg. this
medication dose was increased to 40 mg for goal ldl <70
considering diabetes and stroke.  please follow up lft's to
ensure tolerating, and lipid profile to ensure she meets her
targets.

brief hospital course:
80 yo f w/ dm2, htn, pa htn p/w sob and le edema x1 week, now
with severe anemia
(hct of 17 noted by her pcp) thought to be secondary to ugib,
hemodynamically stable s/p 6 units of bld w/ increase of hct to
30. serial hcts q 6 hrs remained stable at 30.

pt had egd in ed () which revealed granularity,
friability and erythema in the stomach body, fundus and antrum
compatible with acute gastritis (biopsy obtained). erythema in
the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. ulcer in the
distal bulb. otherwise normal egd to second part of the
duodenum.

echo:()
1. the left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (lvef>55%).
3. the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of , there has been no significant change.

1. gib with increased bun, likely ugib, however lgib initially
considered as well.
pt had 2 large bore iv's placed.  ng lavage was positive as well
as stool guiacs. egd as above. no active bleed noted however
ulcer and gastritis likely source of anemia. ulcer thought to be
secondary to nsaid use vs h. pylori.  will treat for h.pylori if
indicated. pt will follow up with gi. asa was held secondary to
bleed.  losartan was initially held, then restarted at half
normal dose. nsaids were avoided. initially given iv ppi 
which was then changed to po. colonoscopy performed was reported
to be normal.

2. cardiac. ekg changes (nsr at 84, nl axis and intervals, twi
iii, twi v1-v4). pt was ruled out for mi with three sets of neg
cardiac enzymes. she denied cp. ecg changes likely secondary to
demand ischemia from severe anemia. she was initially monitored
on tele with no events. an echo done on , as above
(lvef>55%). sob most likely due to discontinuation of lasix for
one week in setting of diastolic chf. treated with 40 of lasix
iv (held off on diuresis intially secondary to concern for gi
bld).

3. resp. cxr done on  without overt evidence of chf or
pneumonia. findings suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.
 she required o2 supplementation during her stay and was noted
to have ra sats in the 80's with ambulation likely secondary to
pa htn. she was sent home on supplemental o2. a repeat cxr was
suggestive of pulm congestion. lasix given as above.

4. dm2. initially bld sugars controlled with riss, oral
hyperglycemics were restarted prior to discharge.

5. anemia secondary to gastritis and pud, as well as fe/vit b12

impression:
1. thickening and ill-definition of the right brachial plexus
just lateral to the superior ribs and inferior to the
subscapularis muscle immediately below the coracoid process,
likely secondary to trauma. no mass or hematoma impinging upon
the nerves within the axilla or medially. the appearance of the
nerves as they course by the proximal humeral shaft fracture is
not well evaluated on this study as it is too peripheral.
2. humeral shaft fracture and hemorrhage within the subcoracoid

3. cervical spine disc degeneration seen on cervical spine mr.
 thoracic injury seen on prior imaging of uncertain cause.
.
hand (ap, lat & oblique) right    pm
three views of the right hand: there is diffuse osseous
demineralization. there are degenerative changes with no
definite fracture. joint spaces are preserved.
three views of the right wrist: alignment is normal. no
fractures are identified. there are multiple rounded calcific
bodies in the dorsal soft tissues that do not appear to be
fracture fragments.
three views of the right elbow: alignment is normal. no
fractures are identified. there is an enthesophyte at the
posterior olecranon.
.
c-spine ct: there is no evidence of cervical spine fracture.
bulky
calcifications of the posterior longitudinal ligament are
identified at the c2-4 levels, likely resulting in moderate
spinal stenosis.  multilevel degenerative changes are identified
with disc space and osteophyte formation. bridging osteophytes
are identified at c7-t2.  the t1-3 processes appear fused.
there is marked irregularity of the inferior endplate of t3 and
superior endplate of t4 with impaction of these vertebral bodies
onto each other and acute kyphotic angulation at this level.
these findings are likely chronic.  there is no prevertebral
soft tissue swelling.  the lung apices are clear.
impression:  no acute cervical spine fracture.  extensive
degenerative changes as described above.
.
head ct: findings:  there is hyperdensity along the left frontal
vertex that is likely secondary to volume averaging.  there is
no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major
vascular territorial infarction.  hypodensity in the
periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemia. small prior infarcts are identified in
the right internal capsule basal ganglia and left external

brief hospital course:
summary:
briefly, this is a 81 year old russian speaking woman who
presented status post fall.  no intracranial bleed. no hip
fracture. + r humerus fracture. ct of c-spine showed severe
stenosis. she was initially admitted to the medicine service for
workup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm
following r humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed
central cord and brown-sequard syndrome and transferred to the
neurology service for closer exam monitoring.  she underwent  r
humerus orif and c2-c6 laminectomy and fusion on . a med
consult was obtained on  for persistent hypoxia. she was
gently diuresed, and had serial abg's which showed persistent
hypercarbia. during the admission, she was also treated with
cipro for a uti.
.
neuro: the patient could not recall the events surrounding the
fall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal
humerus, displaced, and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness
distally in all 4 extremities.  on exam she initially was found
to have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness
affecting arms more so than legs.  she also had evidence of a
brown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on
the right with an upgoing toe, and pin sensation is down on the
left, sensory level of c4/t3 anteriorly on the left (where the
two dermatomes meet at the top of the breast).  she was
complaining of neck pain, and had had trouble voiding so a foley
was placed.
.
mri of the c-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute
spinal cord injury with above findings.  read of mri was: bulky
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at c2/3,
c3/4, and c4/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe
spinal canal stenosis.the cervical cord at those levels is
deformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic t2 hyperintense
signal.  there is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of c3
anteriorly.  she was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain
was controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially.  she was
seen by both neurosurgery and orthopedics for the injury as both
services had been alternately covering the spine service in the
hospital.  orthopedics also followed her for the broken right
humerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ed
when a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later
proven to be artifactual).
.
both  and neurosurgery agreed that it was safest for the
patient to hold off on the spine surgery for at least a week to
allow cord swelling to heal before operating.  she remained in a
hard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next
week; the pinprick sensory level retracted to the t12 region for
days, then finally seemed to vanish altogether; the
proprioceptive changes on the right also resolved.  although the
right arm remained weak and flaccid with just  finger flexors
and trapezius/shoulder shrug  (initially thought just limited
by pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength
improved to deltoid , /tri both 4+ to 5-/5, and wrist and
finger extensors 4+/5; finger flexors were also 4+/5.  on : there were no changes in exam.  for neuropathic pain,
neurontin had been initiated (patient later requested d/c to
simplify med regimen).
.
the weekend of  on morning rounds, a mild right horner's
syndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily
rounds.  this, along with the flaccid arm, was suggestive of
root avulsion on the right (and associated plexopathy).
her neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during
hospitalization.
.
:
pt underwent r humerus orif and cervical laminectomy (report
below), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted
for hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pco2
in high 50's). she has a follow up appointment on  with
 to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her c-collar

.
hypoxia/hypercarbia:
pt had hx of severe pulm htm, likely  pda. abg showed mild
co2 retention, ? if this was close to her baseline. also likely
had component of fluid overload, given recent surgery.  pt was
gently diuresed with iv lasix. narcotics were d/c'd as pt
appeared somnolent. o2 was successfully weaned down to 2l nc (pt
apparently had been on 2l o2 at home). cta on admission was
negative for pe, and the suspicion for pe was fairly low post-op
given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement
improved.  therefore, repeat cta was not done. she was also
noted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory
status remained stable while on the medicine service.
.
status post fall: the original fall was of unclear etiology. the
differential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset
afib/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness. less
likely include myocardial infarction/ischemia versus pulmonary
embolism versus seizure. also less likely hypoglycemia given
timing after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally
cleared in setting of increased creatinine.  the patient ruled
out for mi by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe
valvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry
showed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib.  she had no
other significant tele events while in the hospital.
.
elevated wbc and lactate at admission: unclear etiology,
afebrile with negative ua and infectious workup at admission.
this cleared on its own.  later in hospitalization () she had
a uti treated with course of ciprofloxacin. urine cxlood cx, and
cath tip cx were sent prior to d/c to workup somnolence, however
pt's somnolence cleared and cx's were pending on d/c. these
should be followed at her follow up appointments.
.
musculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative
for fracture or bleed including right ue, hips bilaterally,
c-spine and head. patient with known chronic low back pain and
sciatica.
.
hypertension/pulmonary hypertension: continued asa, held
valsartan. lasix initially held for renal failure but was
restarted once she was clinically stable.
.
hypercholesterolemia: continued home dose of lipitor
.
renal: she has slight renal insufficiency at admission and was
given gentle ivf. her electrolytes were followed and repleted as
needed, mvi and continued niferex.  arf improved. she should
have her potassium and bun/creatinine followed at regular
intervals starting 2-3 days post discharge, as she was
discharged on her home dose of  and new dose of lasix.

prophylaxis: the patient was maintained on teds, sq heparin,
ppi, bowel regimen.  she complained of rle pain one day, and u/s
was ordered to r/o dvt - this study was negative.

surgeon:   ,  

procedure:  im nail right humerus.

assistant:  .

indications for procedure:  ms.  is an 81-year-old
woman who sustained a fall and has a displaced right proximal
humerus fracture. she also has a spine injury and this has
been operated on by dr.  . given the displacement of
her fracture and that she is having pain and not tolerating
nonoperative treatment, we decided to proceed with
intramedullary nailing.

description of procedure:  after informed consent was
obtained and dr.  had completed his spinal portion
of the case, the patient was placed in the supine position.
the right arm was prepped and draped in normal sterile
fashion.

a 3 cm incision was made over the proximal humerus and the
deltoid was split. eentry point was established in the
proximal humerus and the guide wire placed. the fracture was
held reduced and the guide wire passed into the distal
humerus. the proximal part of the humerus was reamed and
then the canal was reamed up to a size 10 mm. next a 230 by
10 mm  and nephew nail was placed and interlocked with 2
screws proximally. the distal locking screw was placed under
image intensification. wounds were irrigated and closed with
0 vicryl, 2-0 and a subcuticular 3-0. postoperatively, she
was brought back to the recovery room in stable condition.

complications:  none.

as the attending surgeon i was present for and performed the
entire procedure.

history of present illness:
82yo russian speaking f with a pmh of type ii dm, htn,
hyperlipidemia, obesity, pulmonary htn and anemia, who presented
to the ed this am with worsening sob x 2 weeks. per the ed
resident, the patient noted that she had had worsening sob x 2
weeks (documented as 2 days  rn note) and also complained of
orthopnea and increasing lower extremity swelling and weeping
from a venous stasis ulcer on her l shin. the patient was able
to communicate this verbally to er resident (rn notes she was
only able to speak in 4 word sentences). her vna stated that she
was only 94% on 2l o2 at home and had rales  way up
bilaterally. on initial assessment in the  er, her vital
signs were t 98.2, bp 167/60, hr 61, rr 23, sats 100% on ra. on
next assessment (2 hrs later), pt was felt to be very sob while
attempting to use the bed pan. rn noted her to be dusky,
diaphoretic. hr 72, rr 28, sats 90% on ra. she was placed on a
nrb with improvement in her o2 sats to 98%. bp rose to 210/74,
then 215/93. cxr was taken and read as c/w pneumonia. blood cx
were obtained and ceftriaxone was administtered. 90 mins later,
she was felt to be diaphoretic again, with increased work of
breathing. her o2 sats dropped to 90% by nrb and she was prepped
for intubation. she was given 2mg versed and was intubated. sbp
210 -> 178 -> 130. she was taken to ct scan for cta. on return
from ct scan, she was felt to be bucking the vent. she was given
fentanyl 100mcg, with resultant drop in her sbp to 77. she was
then bolused 1l of ns with improvement in her sbp to 96. she was
also given vecuronium 10mg iv and ativan 1mg iv because of
inability to ventilate and biting at the tube.
.
on review, she was given: 1gm ctx iv x1, ? azithromcyin 500mg iv
x1, lasix 20mg x1, 120mg succinylcholine iv, etomidate 20mg iv,
12.5mg versed iv, and fentanyl 100mcg x1. she was also given 1
dose of mucomyst prior to her ct scan.

brief hospital course:
this is a 84 year-old female with a history of pulmonary
hypertension, diastolic chf, who presented with weakness,
hypotension, guaiac positive stools.
.

# hypotension - her hypotension and anemia were felt to be due
to blood loss from rectus sheath hematoma.  unknown exactly how
the hematoma occurred (?secondary to heparin injection while
recently hospitalized)but was well visualized on the abdominal
ct that she had in the er.  she was evaluated by gi (due to
anemia and guaiac positive stools), who found external
hemorrhoids on exam and stated there was little or no concern
regarding duodenal angioectasia as source of hematocrit drop.
they followed and plans for c-scope if she started bleeding
again.   her hct was 22 on admission, microcytic.  she received
3 units of blood in total and her hematocrit stablized at 29-30
for several days.  her blood pressure was 80/40 on admission and
she was admitted to the micu, but did not require pressors, her
bp increased with blood and fluids (2l).  in the icu she was on
a po ppi, had two large bore ivs, as well as central access.
her hct was checked q6 hours and transfusion parameter was 26.
her aspirin was held.  her bp increased to teens over 80's and
she was transferred to the medical floor after one day in the
micu.  on the medical floor her blood pressure remained in the
120's/80's initially but then increased to 140's.  her
lisinopril, valsartan, metoprolol and furosemide were held
initially due to her relatively low blood pressure and increased
creatinine (see below). her furosemide was restarted on the last
day of hospitalization due to blood pressure that would tolerate
it and signs of hypervolemia.
in addition she had several bowel movements on the day prior to
admission, likely due to many laxatives she was receiving.  she
did not have a  leukocytosis, fever.  the stool was guiaic
negative.  her laxatives were discontinued except docusate.
.
# acute renal failure - pre-renal secondary to
hypotension/hypovolemia.  c her electrolytes and volume status
were stable.  her lisinopril, lasix and valsartan were held and
continue to be held as her blood pressure is in the 130's.  her
creatinine was 3.4 on admission with a baseline of 1.6.  her
creatinine decreased to 1.4 after hydration and her lasix was
restarted at her home dose of 80mg po bid.
.
# leukocytosis - wbc on admission was very high, likely
reactive, given hypotension, and acute blood loss.  blood and
urine cultures were negative and she had no diarrhea.  her cxr
was unremarkable and antibiotics were deferred as there was no
source of infection, she was afebrile and her leukocytosis
resolved (wbc was 7 for the last two days of admission).
.
# hyperlipidemia - she continued to take atorvastatin

major surgical or invasive procedure:
none

history of present illness:
this is an 87 year old lady with a pmh of diastolic heart
failure (ef>75%), severe lung disease and resultant pulmonary
hypertension, t2dm, obesity, who presents from home with hypoxia
and worsening somnolence.

patient reports that since discharge from the hospital on
 , she has had persistent increased sputum which
she has difficulty coughing up.  she feels like the sputum gets
caught in her throat.  it is white-clear.  she denies fever or
chills.  she denies worsening dyspnea, but has only ambulated in
her house as she hasn't been feeling well.  she endorses mild
orthopnea.  she denies worsening lower extremity edema.

of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxia with cxr
findings of a lul.  she had presented to her cardiologist one
week prior to initial admission with complaints of worsening
dyspnea and increased sputum production, without fever or
leukocytosis.  at that time, cardiologist felt that patient was
having an acute flare of her chronic bronchitis, and placed her
on a one week course of levofloxacin.  a cxr was performed at
the time to rule out pneumonia which was negative for
consolidation.  she followed up with the cardiologist np one
week later, and was found to have o2sats ranging from 68-80% on
3l nc (baseline, home oxygen).  she continued to be afebrile
without leukocytosis but reported no improvement in sputum
production or dyspnea.  she was sent to the er where a repeat
cxr showed bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for
pneumonia.  she was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and
admitted to the medicine service.  antibiotics were not
continued as patient was afebrile, without cough or
leukocytosis.  right lower extremity ultrasound was negative for
dvt.  patient was discharged home as her oxygen saturations
returned to baseline on home 3l nc.

tuberculosis.  he does not know of anyone in his family who was
exposed to tuberculosis.

brief hospital course:
87 yo f with a history of diastolic heart failure, pulmonary
hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and chronic bronchitis
admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure. hospital course
notable for acute renal failure.

#hypoxia/atypical pneumonia/pulmonary hypertension/chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease/acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure/hypercarbic respiratory failure/obstructive sleep apnea:
patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit with
hypercarbic respiratory which was felt to be due to over
oxygenation, and most likely worsening pulmonary hypertension
from volume overload and atypical pneumonia. she was diuresed
and treated with azithromycin with improvement in her symptoms.
she was also seen by the pulmonary service for evaluation of her
pulmonary hypertension and episodes of apnea and they
recommended an outpatient sleep study. the patient did well and
was transferred from the intensive care unit to the medical
floor and improved with antibiotics and further diuresis and was
discharged on home oxygen of 2-3l nc. given that
over-ventilation and over-oxygenation was felt to contribute to
the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence,
the patient should have oxygen for a target oxygen saturation of
89-93%.

#pulmonary nodules:
patient had sputum production and a chest ct which showed 3 left
uppe lobe lung nodules that were most likely felt to be
infectious. she was ruled out for tb with 3 negative sputa for
afb and patient received course of azithromycin. she should have
a follow up cxr in 6 weeks. patient and son were made aware of
this and the importance of follow up.

#acute on chronic diastolic heart failure:
as above patient was admitted in volume overload. hospital
course was notable for improvement in symptoms with diuresis,
but complicated by acute renal failure (see below). patient was
ultimately discharged euvolemic on regimen of lasix 80mg once
daily to keep her euvolemic and tbb even.

#acute on chronic renal failure:
during diuresis for acute heart failure, patient developed acute
renal failure with probable contraction alkalosis. at this point
diuresis was stopped, gentle fluids were given, and diuretics
were stared when renal function had returned to .
lisinopril was held and should be started 3 days after discharge
at 2.5mg po daily.

# hypertension: blood pressure was well controlled on home
regimen. diltiazem was continued but lisinopril was held during
acute renal failure.

# diabetes mellitus:  hgba1c 6.5 in 7/.  on glipizide at
home. patient was covered with sliding scale insulin in the
hospital. glipizide can be restarted once renal function
stabilizes.

# transitional issues:
afb cultures will need to be followed-up
she will need close pulmonary follow-up for repeat imaging in
several weeks (fu of pulmonary nodules as well as follow up of
her likely copd, severe pulmonary hypertension, and probable
sleep apnea
.
#disposition: patient was discharged to rehab.

discharge instructions:
dear mrs :

it was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital during your
stay; you were taken care of by a critical care team during your
icu stay and a medicine primary team during your inpatient
hospitalization.  during your stay you received treatment for
congestive heart failure and continued treatment for a possible
pneumonia.  you will need to continue to restrict your salt
intake in order to prevent exacerbations of your heart failure.

additionally, there was significant concern that you have
obstructive sleep apnea. you have appointments to see a sleep
medicine specialist and a pulmonologist.

the following changes were made to your medication regimen:
1) start guaifenesin  100 mg/5 ml syrup  sig:  ten (10) ml po
q6h (every 6 hours) as needed for sputum production/cough
2) start albuterol 0.083% neb solution, 1 nebulizer every 4
hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing
3) you may use saline nasal spray as needed for nasal dryness.
4) your lasix dose was decreased to 80mg once daily (instead of
twice per day).
.
please try to avoid ibuprofen and other nsaids orally if
possible because these could further damage your kidneys.
please be sure to weigh yourself every morning and call your
primary care doctor if weight is increasing by more than 3 lbs.
you may need to have your lasix increased again.

please be sure to keep all of your followup appointments as
listed below, including your followup with the cardiologist next
week.
.
no other changes were made to your medications and you should
continue to take all your other medications as originally
prescribed.

for a right subtrochanteric femur fracture after being evaluated
and treated with closed reduction in the emergency room. she was
noted to have a hct=25.7, with a baseline of 30-32, so she was
given 2 units of packed red cells overnight. in addition, she
received one dose of kayexalate for hyperkalemia to 5.7 without
ekg changes. she underwent open reduction internal fixation of
the fracture without complication on . please see
operative report for full details. she was extubated without
difficulty and transferred to the recovery room in stable
condition. in the early post-operative course ms. 
developed anuria, with a creatinine bump above her baseline, and
she was transferred to the tsicu for further monitoring and
treatment of her volume status and worsening renal
insufficiency. during this time, she was transfused an
additional 2 units of packed red cells. she remained in the icu
overnight and eventually showed improvement with good urine
output, and was transferred to the floor in stable condition.

on hospital day 3 she was transfused an additional 2 units of
packed red cells for post-operative anemia. on hospital day 5,
she received a visit from the russian cardiology service who
recommended restarting her home lasix, which was done.

she continued to make good urine had adequate pain management
and worked with physical therapy while in the hospital.  the

history of the present illness:  this is a 66-year-old man
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in
, at which time they performed a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous
vein graft to the om-i and om-ii sequential and saphenous
vein graft to the pda.  he is also status post stenting of
his saphenous vein graft to the om-i, om-ii territory in
, and ptca and brachytherapy to the saphenous
vein graft to the om-i, om-ii in .   the
patient also has a past medical history significant for
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, depression, mild dementia, history of
tia, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies in .

the patient is a 66-year-old male with a long-standing
history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted  due to unstable angina with a troponin level ranging
between 4.5 and 5.9.  cardiac catheterization was performed
on  which revealed a patent left internal
mammary artery graft, occluded om-1 and om-2 graft, and a 90%
occlusion in the in-stented segment of the pda.  the last
echocardiogram was performed in  which revealed a
left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%.

admission medications:
1.  atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  aricept 5 mg p.o. q.d.

12. nitroglycerin patch.
13. plavix which is being held.
14. nph insulin 12 units q.a.m., 8 units q.p.m., regular
insulin 4 units q.a.m.

hospital course:  an off-pump redo coronary artery bypass
grafting was performed on .  it was a
coronary artery bypass grafting times one with the saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal via left thoracotomy
incision.

the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery
unit in stable condition on neo-synephrine at 0.6 micrograms
per kilogram per minute and propofol in normal sinus rhythm
at 57 beats per minute.  he was extubated the same day of
surgery without any incidents around  p.m.

on postoperative day number one, the patient had a low-grade
temperature at 100.3 in sinus rhythm at 88.  the vital signs
were stable.  the white count was 9.1, hematocrit 31.3,
platelet count 147,000 with an unremarkable physical
examination.  the plan was to continue to keep his blood
pressure down on nipride and to start the patient on his p.o.
medications as well as his p.o. diet.  if able to wean off
the nipride, the plan was to transfer the patient to the
floor.

on postoperative day number two, the patient was mildly
disoriented, however, calm without complaints with his pain
well controlled.  he was still with a low-grade temperature
of 100.1 in sinus rhythm at 88, mildly hypertensive at
170/88.  on physical examination, he had mild crackles
bilaterally, otherwise his examination was benign.  the plan
was just to continue monitor his mental status and pain
control.

on postoperative day number three, the patient was still
without complaints, however, still requiring a sitter for his
disorientation.  currently, afebrile.  the vital signs were
stable, saturating at 94% on room air.  the physical
examination was benign.  the plan was to go for a cardiac
catheterization this morning with a possible ptca with plus
or minus stenting of the stenotic area.

he did undergo cardiac catheterization on 
which now revealed a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse
marginal patent and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending artery with a 90% distal stenosis with a 3 by 13
mm stent with distal protection and 0% residual with normal
flow.  the plan was to continue the patient on aspirin and
plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for 30 days and to administer
integrelin overnight.

the anticipated date of discharge is .  the
patient is to be discharged home on the following
medications.

discharge medications:

history of present illness:  the patient is a 41-year-old
male with a longstanding history of seizure disorder and
mental retardation who presented to the emergency room with a
possible asthma exacerbation, as well as some right arm
shaking. the patient has a longstanding seizure disorder, by
report both gtc and complex partial. the patient's seizures
have been relatively well controlled for the past year up to
a few weeks ago. the patient did have an episode of
unresponsiveness thought to be a postictal state. he was
recently admitted on  at  for asthma exacerbation. he was seen by
neurology at that time for questioned seizure activity. his
keppra was increased during that hospitalization from 5,000
b.i.d. to 2,000 b.i.d.

on the morning of admission, the patient was found by ems to
have an o2 saturation in the 80s and appeared apneic. it was
felt that he again was having an asthmatic exacerbation. he
was intubated in the field and brought to 
  . at , he was noted to have some right arm shaking, which
was felt to be a seizure episode. he received 8 mg of ativan
and was placed on propofol. he was also noted to have some
teeth chattering.

allergies:  phenobarbital, phenytoin, penicillin, haldol.

physical examination:  vital signs:  temperature 100.0, heart
rate 76, blood pressure 132/77, saturation of 100 percent on
vent assist control/650/20/5 on 85 percent, not
overbreathing, pip-31. general:  intubated, sedated male,
appearing slightly rigid. heent:  pupils were 2 cm minimally
reactive to light. lungs:  expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm. no murmurs, rubs or
gallops. abdomen:  soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds. extremities:  no cyanosis, clubbing or edema,
2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
neurological:  the patient was sedated, but would withdraw to
pain.

hospital course:  the patient was admitted to the medical
intensive care unit.

respiratory:  the patient was continued on q.i.d. albuterol
nebulizations. his sedation was lightened and he was
successfully extubated the following day. admission arterial
blood gas was 7.48/39/404. it was uncertain whether or not
the patient actually had asthmatic exacerbation. he was
initially given solu-medrol 125 mg intravenously. however,
this was discontinued the following day. he appeared stable
with regard to his respiratory status at the time of
discharge. he did not have an aa gradient.

neurological:  a neurology consult was obtained at the time
of admission. since there were no clear jerking or rhythmic
movements and since the patient's group home representatives
stated that this was not his typical seizure activity, it was
unclear whether or not the patient was actually having
seizures. at the time of admission, he received 8 mg of
ativan. his outpatient regimen of seizure medications was
continued. this included depakote, keppra, valium and
neurontin. the patient had no obvious seizure activity during
his medical intensive care unit stay. an electroencephalogram
was obtained by the neurology service, which was consistent
with encephalopathy, but did not reveal any seizure activity.
levels of valproate were measured and found to be within
range.

mental status:  the patient was initially fairly somnolent.
however, over the course of the day, he was able to become
more alert. a representative from the patient's group home
was scheduled to see the patient to decide whether or not he
was at his baseline. the patient was able to eat and take his
medications without difficulty during his hospitalization.

condition on discharge:  stable.

discharge status:  to group home.

discharge diagnoses:  mental retardation.

seizure disorder.

asthma.

depression.

discharge medications:  no changes were made to the patient's
outpatient regimen.

history of present illness:  the patient is with mental
retardation, seizure disorder, asthma, and recurrent
aspiration pneumonia, who was admitted to the intensive care
unit already intubated for apnea.

on the day of admission, the patient was sitting bolt upright
in bed in respiratory distress.  he was given albuterol neb
without improvement.  at that time his oxygen saturation was
88 percent, and he was intubated for apnea.

an initial chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe opacities
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  he was extubated on
the day after admission.

on presentation the patient was febrile and started on
levofloxacin and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  he was
called out to the floor three days after admission.

past medical history:  seizure disorder secondary to anoxic
brain injury.  over the past three months, the patient has
had increasing seizure activity from baseline according to
his primary caretaker.

b.i.d., citalopram.

family history:  no seizure disorder.

allergies:  phenobarbital, penicillin, haldol.

physical examination:  vital signs:  upon transfer to the
medical floor, temperature was 97.9 with a t-max of 101,
pulse 83, ranging from 51-126, blood pressure 110/47,
respirations 21, ranging from 21-32, oxygen saturation 97
percent on 4 l nasal cannula.  general:  examination was
significant for a young black male in no acute distress.  the
patient was awake and responding to voice appropriately.
heent:  moist mucous membranes.  pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  neck:  supple.  cardiovascular:  normal
s1 and s2.  regular rate and rhythm.  lungs:  decreased
breath sounds at the bases with a few audible wheezes.
abdomen:  normoactive bowel sounds.  extremities:  no edema.

laboratory data:  white count 6.4, hematocrit 40.5;
creatinine 0.9,  1.6.

assessment:  this was a 41-year-old male with mental
retardation, recently worsening seizure disorder, on triple
medication therapy, admitted with  aspiration and probable
aspiration pneumonia.

aspiration pneumonia:  the patient was treated with a seven-
day course of levofloxacin.  he was initially treated with
flagyl; however, this was discontinued before day 7 because
of his tendency to decreased seizure threshold.  the patient
was placed on aspiration precautions.

during his hospitalization, he had multiple episodes of
unresponsiveness, which were likely post ictal states.  in
addition, he had multiple seizure activity, and therefore was
deemed to unstable to go down for a video swallow.  a bed
side speech and swallow evaluation recommended ground/pureed
food with thickened liquids.  the patient tolerated this diet
well.

in addition, the patient was placed on a quick steroid taper
with nebs p.r.n.

after starting antibiotics, the patient remained afebrile for
the rest of his admission, and his lung examination
normalized.  he was on room air at the time of this
dictation.

seizure disorder:  over the past few months, the patient's
seizure disorder has been worsening.  initially on admission,
his keppra dose was decreased to 1500 b.i.d.  he was
continued on his home dose of valproic acid and gabapentin.
the patient had multiple episodes of witnessed seizures, some
tonic and two short tonic clonic seizures.  these responded
to intravenous ativan; however, on two episodes, he had
probable seizure activity with bilateral  up and out for more
than 20 min.

neurology was consulted.  the patient received two eegs
during his hospitalization, both of which did not demonstrate
seizure activity.  there was generalized swelling, likely due
to medication affect.  the patient was transferred to the
epilepsy service for continuous monitoring.

psychiatric:  the patient has a history of combative behavior
and multiple psychiatric security codes being called.  a
similar code was called during this hospitalization.

psychiatry was involved and recommended  p.r.n. for
agitation.

prior to transfer to the neurology service, the patient's
dose of keppra was increased back to his home dose of  mg
p.o. b.i.d.

the patient was maintained on seizure precautions.

the patient is full code.

this portion of the dictation summary was dictated by the
general medicine team.  an  will be dictated by the
neurology service after the patient receives continuous eeg
monitoring.

the effusion appears circumferential. there is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. there is brief right ventricular
diastolic compression/collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology. moderate pericardial effusion
with echo evidence of tamponade.
.
ct chest with contrast ():
no evidence of pulmonary embolism. massive progression of
disease with substantial generalized severe mediastinal and
hilar lymphadenopathy, newly appeared bilateral pleural
effusions, newly appeared pericardial effusion, newly appeared
multifocal pneumonia, and evidence of lymphangitis
carcinomatosa.

brief hospital course:
52 year old woman with a pmh significant for metastatic breast
cancer with lung and brain metastases admitted originally to the
 for management of respiratory distress, then transferred to
ccu after pericardiocentesis for cardiac tampoande, then
transferred to  after pt's respiratory status stabilized.
.
#. hypoxic respiratory distress: on presentation to the icu, the
patient denied any fevers but reported a productive cough of
several months duration. cxr on arrival demonstrated left
peri-hilar and basilar infiltrates with concern for infectious
consolidation/pneumonia, pleural effusion or progression of
metastatic disease as her cancer was known to be located in the
left lower lobe. a ct with contrast was performed to further
evaluate the intrapulmonary process and demonstrated a
multifocal pneumonia, progression of the pulmonary metastases,
pleural effusions as well as a moderate-to-large pericardial
effusion (see below for management of pericardial effusion) but
was negative for a pulmonary embolism. given productive cough
and radiographic evidence the patient was started on levaquin
and vancomycin for robust cap treatment. on review of her
medical chart, hcap was considered more likely and she was
started on levoquin and cefipime. blood and urine cultures were
performed and showed no growth as well as an influenza dfa,
which was negative. the patient was maintained on oxygen by
nasal canula to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
urine culture showed no growth though ua was positive for
leukocytes, as she was already on broad spectrim antibiotics, no
additional coverage was added. antibiotics were changed to
levaquin and flagyl to cover postobstructive pneumonia, she will
finish a course of 8 days on . on , patient spiked
fever to 100.9 and cefipime was restarted. after arrival to
, pt remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so
cepfepime was dc'd again.  pulmonary was consulted and per their
recs, vanc was restarted and flagyl was dc'd after 5 days.  pt
ultimately completed 8d of levoquin and at time of discharge,
vanc was changed to linezolid to complete the course at home.
cough was treated symptomatically.  pt was discharged with o2
suppl.
.
#. pericardial effusion: patient was tachycardic on
presentation. there was concern that it may be related to the
patient's hypoxia or another underlying process such as a pe or
possibly hypovolemia. antibiotics for her pneumonia as above.
intravenous fluids were given for hypovolemia with little change
in heart rate. a ct was ordered as above to evaluate further,
which was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did reveal a
moderate-to-large pericardial effusion. a tte was ordered to
evaluate further and revealed evidence of tamponade physiology.
moreover, the patient had a pulsus paradoxus of 16-18 mm hg on
exam. the interventional cardiology service was contact who
performed pericardiocentesis which produced 470ml serosanguanous
fluid which was consistent with exudate by lites criteria. over
the next day, the drain put out another 500cc of fluid. the
fluid was sent for cultures which were all negative.  cytology
on pericarial fluid was positive for malignant cells. after one
day, the pericardial drain was pulled, and the tip sent for
culture which was also negative, and the patient was transfered
out of the ccu. after arrival to , pt remained stable on nc,
however clinically appeared still distressed.  on , a
repeat echo was performed and it showed small pericardical
effusion, reassuring us that the fluid had not reaccumulated.
per cardiology recs, pt was instrusted to get another repeat
echo on  when she return for her outpt appt with
oncologist, dr. . dr.  will follow-up on the echo
results.
.
# anion gap metabolic acidosis: patient presented with a mild
metabolic acidosis and an anion gap of 15. the most immediate
concern was for a lactic acidosis from her respiratory distress
and impaired tissue oxygenation or a possible starvation
ketosis. repeat labs the morning after admission revealed a
worsening of her acidosis with a hco3 of 15 (down from 20 on
admission). an abg revealed an appropriate respiratory
compensation with a pco2 of 31. the metabolic acidosis soon
resolved and pt remained stable.
.
# breast cancer: ct on admission showed dramatic progression of
metastatic disease involving the lungs bilaterally. she was
continued on capecitabine 1000 mg , and transfered to the
oncology service. once on , given pt's breast cancer was
progressing on current therapy (ca27-29 rising) and pt's
clinical status was deteriorating, inpt attending and outpt
oncologist dr.  discussed started a new chemotherapy
regimen.  thus, pt's capecitabine was stopped and on  pt
was given herceptin, docetaxel and carboplatin.  20 minutes into
the infusion, herceptin was stopped bc pt developed sob and
hypoxia to mid 80s.  pt's symptoms resolved with time, ativan
and lasix.  herceptin was attempted again on .  this
time the infusion was stopped 60 min into the infusion bc pt
developed tachycardia. pt's symptoms resolved with time.  pt was
started on neupogen 24 hours after chemotherapy administration
to prevent neutropenia.  the neupogen was discontinued on day of
discharge as pt's wbc was still >15.
.
# elevated lfts: pt had midly elevated lfts after chemo
administration, which were trending down with time.
.
# diarrhea:  pt developed diarrhea during the hospitalization.
c diff was negative.  likely  chemo.  diarrhea improved with
imodium.
.
# anemia: hematocrit on admission was approximately 39, at the
patient's known baseline. the patient subsequently received
several liters of intravenous fluids for her tachycardia and her
hematocrit came down to 35. pt's hct remained stable in the
31-35 range.  pt did not require any transfusions.
.
# crohn's: patient was continued on her mesalamine without
event.
.
# pt was on regular diet.  pt was full code.  pt was on sc
heparin for dvt ppx.

characterized dull general abdominal pain.  the pain was
described as sharp, constant.  the pain radiated to the back.
it got worse with motion, better with motrin.  the pain was
associated with nausea and bilious vomiting times 1, subsequent
to the onset of pain.  the patient also described subjective
fevers and chills.  the paitent did not have any constipation,
diarrhea, change in the color of her stools, dysuria, hematuria,

pelvic ultrasound :
impression:
1. fibroid uterus.
2. normal appearing ovaries bilaterally. no ovarian torsion seen
at the time of the exam, although clinical correlation is needed
to entirely exclude this diagnosis.
3. mild-to-moderate amount of nonspecific free pelvic fluid.

abdominal ct :
abdomen ct with iv contrast: there is a trace right pleural
effusion and slight atelectasis at the right lung base. the ng
tube extends into the stomach, where it makes a loop in the
fundus. there is a large amount of fluid in the peritoneum. the
liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and ureters
appear unremarkable. the gallbladder is distended without ct
evidence of wall edema.

the proximal small bowel is collapsed. the mid small bowel is
distended with air-fluid levels. the distal small bowel is not
distended. rectal contrast opacifies the colon, reaching the
cecum. there is severe thickening of the cecal wall. the
appendix seems to be normal in caliber although surrounded by
inflammatory changes and fluid . these findings are most
consistent with cecitis, which could be infectious or
inflammatory. ischemic etiology is less likely.

pelvic ct with iv contrast: the uterus is enlarged with multiple
fibroids, some of which demonstrate calcified rims. the bladder
and rectum are unremarkable. there is a large amount of fluid
tracking down from the abdomen.

bone windows: the visualized osseous structures appear
unremarkable.

ct reconstructions: multiplanar reconstructions were essential
in evaluating bowel anatomy. there is severe cecal wall
thickening. the appendix is normal in caliber.

impression:
1) inflammatory changes in the rigth lower quadrant most likely
consistent with cecitis, which could be infectious or
inflammatory. ischemic etiology less likely.
2) large amount of intraperitoneal fluid.
3) dilated mid small bowel loops, likely secondary to ileus.
4) fibroid uterus.

pathology:
appendix:
    acute appendicitis with acute serositis.
     no evidence of vasculitis seen.
ileocecal resection specimen:

1.  ileum and proximal margin:
vascular congestion.

2.  colon:
a.  severe vascular congestion, submucosal edema, and transmural
acute hemorrhage.
b.  areas of acute transmural ischemic infarction (slides c and
d).
c.  distal margin:  no infarction.
d.  no convincing evidence of a primary vasculitis.  scattered
small veins have mural acute inflammation and fibrin thrombi,
but these changes are almost certainly secondary to the colonic
wall injury.
e.  one lymph node:  no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

peritoneal fluid:
negative for malignant cells.

echocardiogram:
 conclusions:
the left atrium is normal in size. left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (lvef>55%). due to
suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the
aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
no aortic
regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. no mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral
valve. there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
there is a small
circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for
hemodynamic
compromise.

impression: small circumferential pericardial effusion. no 2d
echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis identified.+


brief hospital course:
the patient was initially taken emergently to the operating room
for exploratory laparascopy with general surgery back up.  she
was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.  they observed a
normal left tube and , and copius greenish yellow fluid, as
well as right lower quadrant adhesions and a diffusely inflammed
small intestine.  the general surgery team became infvolved and
noted that the appendix was acutely inflamed but there was no
other pathology.  after completion of the exploratory
laparatomy, the patient remained tachycardic, with otherwise
stable vital signs, but required >15 l of resucitation.  despite
this the patients hematocrit rose from 41.3 to 52, and her wbc
rose form 12.9 to 39.7.  the patients urine output also began to
decrease.  the patient was becoming edematous and the patient
had increased respiratory distress.  it was believed that the
patient was third spacing, and the patient was transferred to
the intensive care unit for monitoring.

on post op day 2, the patient was taken back for a reexploration
given that the patient had the hemodynamics above, and the
patients abdominal exam worsened.  in the operating room they
discovered a retroperitoneum that was diffulsely petichial and
ecchymotic, with significant retroperitoneal edema and bowel
edema.  the appendages eppiplocae were hemorrhagic.  there was
pathc purpuring darkening concerning for ischemia of the cecum.
the patient underwent a right colectomy, with an ileosotomy and
right transverse colon mucous fistula.  the patient could not be
closed and the abdomen was left open.  the patient was sent back
to the intensive care unit, intubated.  the infectious disease
and rheumatology services were consulted and were intimately
involved, and the results of the studies they suggested are
listed above.

the patients hemodynamic status improved, although the patient
remained tachycardic and intermittently febrile, although
cultures remained negative and the patient remained on broad
spectrum antibiotics.  she continued to recieve fluid boluses
for decreased urine output on post operative days 3 and 1.  tpn
was started on post operative days 4 and 2.  on post operative
days 5 and 3, the patient had an echocardiogram to rule out an
embolic source for possible mesenteric ischemia, and a hit panel
was sent for decreased platelets.  on post operative days 6 and
4 the patient was brought back to the operating room for closure
of her abdomen.  a vent wean was started on post operative days
7,5,and 1 and continued until postoperative days 10/8/4 when she
was successfully extubated.  her ng tube was also discontinued.
she was transferred to the floor and on postoperative days
12/10/6 the patient was started on sips.  she was seen by
physical therapy, as well as continued on her tpn.  her tpn was
discontinued on the following day, while the patient started
taking clears.  the patient was also seen by enterostomy therapy
to help in teaching.  she remained hemodynamically stable, was
passing stool through her ostomy bag, had a well healing
incision, and was tolerating a regular diet, and was ready for
discharge on post operative day 14/12/8, with a 1 week course of
cipro flagyl to be completed per the infectious disease team.

brief hospital course:
the patient was admitted on  and taken to the operating
room for takedown of her ileostomy and ileocolic anastomosis.
she tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss and was
transferred to the pacu and then the floor.  while on the floor
she began having fevers and tachycardia on pod 1.  blood
cultures were sent with one bottle out of four returning
positive for mrsa.  she was transferred to the icu for closer
monitoring and fluid resucitation.  she recovered three days
later with respect to her tachycardia and was afebrile after 3
days of vancomycin.  back on the floor she was found to have an
ileus with abdominal distension.  we placed an ngt for
decompression and kept her npo.  on pod 7 she was started on
clears and was advanced to a regular diet over the next two
days.  we noted that her surgical wound was draining some
serosanguinous fluid, so we opened up 3-4 staples and packed the
wound with a wet to dry dressing.  she was discharged with vna

history of present illness:   the patient is an 83-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension,
chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and history of a
gastrointestinal bleed, who presented to the emergency
department at  at 8 a.m.
with epigastric pain.  the patient's pain started at
approximately  a.m. on the day of admission after eating
breakfast.  it was described as a burning sensation.  the
patient took one sublingual nitroglycerin without effect.
the patient reportedly denied any shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or headache.  the patient
had been off her aspirin and plavix secondary to a
gastrointestinal bleed in , requiring
hospitalization at .

electrocardiogram obtained in the emergency department showed
upsloping st segments and was initially interpreted as
j-point elevation.  subsequently at 1 p.m., the patient's
systolic blood pressures decreased to the 40s and repeat
electrocardiogram at that time revealed bigeminy with st
elevations of 5 mm in v2 through v4.  cardiology team was
consulted, and the patient brought emergently to the
catheterization laboratory with systolic blood pressures in
the 80s.

in the catheterization laboratory, the patient's blood
pressure was marginal, with pressures between 70s and 80s
systolic, and dopamine drip was started.  initial angiogram
showed significant left anterior descending obstruction.
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  the patient was then
electively intubated, as oxygen saturations were decreasing
on non-rebreather mask.  arterial blood gas as that time was
a ph of 7.16, pco2 of 51, and po2 of 51.

urinalysis was benign.  chest x-ray showed heart size within
normal limits, a prominent pulmonary vasculature was noted,
bilateral interstitial opacities were noted.
electrocardiogram at  a.m. showed sinus at 87 beats per
minute, left axis deviation with left ventricular
hypertrophy, 1 to  elevations in v1, upsloping st
elevations in v2 and v3, no st depressions or qs.

v2 and v3, 2 to  elevations in v4 and v5, st
depressions in ii, iii and avf, q waves developed in v2
through v5, with loss of r wave progression.  cardiac
catheterization from , had the following
findings:  left dominant system with three vessel coronary
artery disease, the left main coronary artery was normal, the
left anterior descending was totally occluded at the site of
the previously-placed proximal stent, the ramus intermedius
branch had a long tubular 80% stenosis, the left circumflex
artery had a 50% proximal stenosis, the first obtuse marginal
branch was totally occluded, and the second obtuse marginal
branch had a 70% origin stenosis, the left posterior
descending artery had a mild luminal irregularity, the right
coronary artery was a small non-dominant vessel and had an
80% proximal stenosis.  successful percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending
in-stent lesion, and successful percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stenting of the ramus intermedius
branch.  hemodynamic measurements performed after the
coronary intervention with the patient intubated requiring
intravenous inotropic support with intra-aortic balloon pump
in the left femoral artery revealed elevated left-sided
filling pressures.  the wedge pressure was 21 mm hg.  the
cardiac index was marginally decreased at 2.1.  as above, an
intra-aortic balloon pump was introduced into the left
femoral artery.

impression:   82-year-old female with previous coronary
artery disease status post recent left anterior descending
stent, class ii congestive heart failure, hypertension,
history of recent gastrointestinal bleed, presents with acute
st elevation, anteroseptal and anterior wall myocardial
infarction.  taken to the catheterization laboratory for
intervention and admitted to the coronary care unit,
intubated, with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place, as
well as on a dopamine drip secondary to hypotension.

hospital course by system:
1.  cardiac:
a.  ischemia:  as above, patient with proximal left anterior
descending stent in-stent re-stenosis as well as significant
occlusion to the ramus intermedius status post intervention.
the patient was started on aspirin and plavix
post-intervention.  peak ck was noted to be 71 to 85, which
was on , which gradually trended down to a
value of 113 on the day of admission.  in addition, the
patient was started on an ace inhibitor and beta blocker once
blood pressure could tolerate.

b.  pump:  as above, patient noted to be in cardiogenic shock
with increased wedge and decreased systolic blood pressure.
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the catheterization
laboratory.  the patient was also given lasix x 1 in the
catheterization laboratory for elevated wedge pressure, and
diuresed well with this one-time dose.  no additional lasix
doses were given on hospital day number one, and greater
attention was paid to improving hemodynamics with pressor and
inotropic agents.  the patient was initially transferred to
the coronary care unit on a dopamine drip, however, was noted
to be markedly tachycardic to as high as 130s to 140s in
sinus rhythm.  the decision was made to discontinue the
dopamine and start milrinone for inotropic effect and
levophed for pressor support.  the patient's blood pressure
was titrated to greater than 60, and the patient's heart rate
subsequently was better controlled in the 80s to 90s.
subsequently, with improved hemodynamics, decision was made
to remove the intra-aortic balloon pump on hospital day
number three.  in addition, on the following day, the
patient's milrinone and levophed drips were discontinued as
the patient was maintaining adequate hemodynamics on her own.
lastly, a decision of whether the patient should be long-term
anticoagulated in light of her recent anterior wall event was
to be evaluated with an echocardiogram.  decision to
anticoagulate long-term will be weighed against the possible
risks in light of underlying gastrointestinal pathology and a
history of a recent gastrointestinal bleed.

c.  rhythm:  patient noted to have a sinus tachycardia on
arrival to the coronary care unit, on a dopamine drip.
subsequently was switched to milrinone and levophed drips.
the patient's sinus tachycardia improved to normal sinus
rhythm with occasional episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia, which was thought secondary to reperfusion.

2.  pulmonary:  patient noted to be hypercarbia and hypoxic
in the catheterization laboratory on a non-rebreather, and
decision for intubation was made.  the patient was maintained
on assist control on arrival to the coronary care unit, and
subsequently was weaned with successful extubation on
hospital day number three.

3.  hematology:  patient with a history of chronic anemia
secondary to chronic autoimmune hemolytic etiology,
maintained on prednisone as an outpatient.  in light of
recent events, the patient was placed on stress dose steroids
through the intravenous, which was subsequently changed to
oral prednisone.  the patient received two to three units of
packed red blood cells while in the coronary care unit
secondary to a slightly decreased hematocrit, which was
thought secondary to her underlying chronic condition as well
as possibly secondary to her gastrointestinal bleed in light
of some coffee-ground emesis.  the patient's hematocrit
remained relatively stable during her hospital stay, with a
range of 28 to 33.

4.  gastrointestinal:  as above, patient with a history of a
gastrointestinal bleed with one to two episodes of
coffee-ground emesis while in the coronary care unit.  coffee
grounds then cleared, and the patient was maintained on
protonix 40 mg intravenously twice a day.  as above, the
patient's hematocrit remained stable for the most part during
her hospital stay, and she remained hemodynamically stable,
and there was no need for gastroenterology consult during
this hospital stay.

5.  renal:  the patient's creatinine status post cardiac
catheterization remained at her baseline, and there were no
acute renal issues while an inpatient at .

6.  fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  patient's
electrolytes were monitored closely, with adequate repletion,
especially in light of some ventricular ectopy noted on
telemetry.  initially nothing by mouth secondary to
intubation, and the patient was started on low-dose tube
feeds at 10 cc/hour, promod with fiber.  upon extubation,
tube feeds were discontinued, and the patient was advanced to
an oral diet without complications.

this has been a dictation detailing the hospital events from
, to .   to follow
detailing the rest of the  hospital course,
including a list of discharge diagnoses, discharge
medications, and plan for discharge and follow up.

please note that this interval dictation takes up on , where the dictation of dr.   previously
dictated left off.

additional hospital course:  the patient was transferred from
the coronary care unit to the floor at approximately 3 a.m.
on , without event.  at approximately 9 a.m., the
patient began to complain of shortness of breath and was
found to be tachycardic to the 150s after walking a distance
to the bathroom.  the patient's electrocardiogram
demonstrated sinus tachycardia with st elevations in leads v2
and v3, otherwise the electrocardiogram was unchanged.  on
examination, the patient had a blood pressure of 146/60,
pulse of 135, pulse oxygenation 98% on 2 liters, was
diffusely wheezy on respiratory examination, and was markedly
diaphoretic, without jugular venous distention or edema.  the
patient was given several doses of intravenous lopressor, as
well as high-dose intravenous lasix.  the pulse oxygenation
transiently fell to 88% on 5 liters face mask, and an
arterial blood gas taken was 7.37/32/56.  a chest x-ray
demonstrated increased congestive heart failure and the
patient was given some nitro paste without effect, and then
begun on nitroglycerin drip as well as additional lasix 80 mg
intravenous push.

the patient rapidly thereafter clinically improved, with a
blood pressure falling from a high in the 170s/80s to 135/76,
with a normalization of respiratory rate and a pulse
oxygenation of 92 to 95% on 6 liters, as well as over a liter
of urine out ultimately, and a clearing of previous wheezing
on examination.

the patient was again cycled with cardiac enzymes, which
revealed a troponin elevated greater than the measurable
range, likely from the prior cardiac events that were
described in dr. dictation.  however, repeated
measurements of creatine kinase failed to demonstrate an
elevation in that enzyme, and rather demonstrated a continued
trend down.  the patient was begun on standing lasix
initially at 40 mg once daily, which was then increased to 40
mg twice a day, and then to 80 mg by mouth twice a day.  the
thought being that the patient had been approximately 4
liters positive during this admission, and that the
above-described events likely represented worsening
congestive heart failure/pulmonary edema in the setting of
volume overload.  additionally, the patient's blood pressure
was better controlled with captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three
times a day, and the patient's lopressor dose as well was
increased to 50 mg by mouth three times a day with good
effect on the patient's cardiac rate.

the patient's hematocrit continued to be stable for the
remainder of this admission.  she had no further respiratory
difficulties, and was seen by physical therapy, who suggested
inpatient therapy to improve the patient's endurance.

the patient was sent for echocardiography, which demonstrated
an ejection fraction between 20 and 25%, with multiple wall
motion abnormalities as described.  in discussion with the
cardiology team, the decision was made not to anticoagulate
the patient at this time, given her recent history of
significant clinical gastrointestinal bleeding.  in
consultation with the patient's attending cardiologist,
decision was made to discharge the patient to rehabilitation
on .

please note that during the sequence described for ,
the patient's electrocardiogram appeared to show sinus
tachycardia with the above-stated st elevations in v2 and v3,
which did resolve with the patient's tachycardia.

additional data:  the patient was sent for echocardiography
on , with the following findings:  symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with extensive regional systolic
dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease,
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, moderate mitral
regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation.  the left
ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be between 20
and 25%.  left ventricular wall motion was noted in detailed
report to have abnormalities in the basal anterior portion,
which was hypokinetic, mild mid-anterior which was akinetic,
basilar and anteroseptal which was akinetic, mid-anteroseptal
which was akinetic, basal inferoseptal which was hypokinetic,
mid-inferoseptal which was hypokinetic, anterior apex which
was akinetic, septal apex which was akinetic, inferior apex
which was akinetic, lateral apex which was akinetic, and apex
which was dyskinetic.

discharge medications:   lasix 80 mg by mouth twice a day,
captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day, ambien 5 mg by
mouth daily at bedtime as needed, prevacid 30 mg by mouth
twice a day, timoptic 5% one drop to both eyes once daily,
xalatan one drop to both eyes once daily, nph four units
subcutaneously twice a day, regular insulin sliding scale,
folate 1 mg by mouth once daily, synthroid 25 mcg by mouth
once daily, plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily for 25 days (to
complete a one month course), lopressor 50 mg by mouth three
times a day and hold for systolic blood pressure less than or
equal to 100 or pulse less than or equal to 60), aspirin 81
mg by mouth once daily, levofloxacin 250 mg by mouth once
daily for five days (to complete a ten day course),
prednisone 50 mg by mouth once daily for four days then
prednisone 40 mg by mouth once daily for four days then
prednisone 30 mg by mouth once daily (this is the patient's
baseline prednisone dose for her autoimmune hemolytic
anemia).

discharge diagnosis:
1.  status post myocardial infarction
2.  congestive heart failure
3.  hypertension
4.  chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia
5.  gastrointestinal bleeding

discharge plan:  the patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation.  she is to follow up with her primary care
physician and cardiologist within one week of discharge from
rehabilitation, as well as with her primary
hematologist/oncologist or other physician for follow up of
chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia.  the patient will be
continued on finger stick blood glucoses four times a day
with regular insulin sliding scale as described.  it is
suggested that the patient's electrolytes be measured every
other day and repleted as necessary.

condition on discharge:   stable.

history of present illness:  the patient is an 83-year-old
woman with a history of coronary artery disease with recent
ccu stay and autoimmune hemolytic anemia who presented again
to the ccu after being admitted to the floor with a two-day
history of weakness, increased shortness of breath, decreased

she had stent to the left anterior descending at an outside
hospital in .  she then represented to  on , with her
anginal equivalent (epigastric pain) and was found to have st
elevations on her electrocardiogram in leads v2-v5.  she had
a complicated emergent catheterization.  the catheterization
placed on dopamine and intubated.

on catheterization, the patient had in stent restenosis of
the left anterior descending, and she received percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty.  a lesion of the ramus
intermedius was stented as well.  intra-aortic balloon pump
was initiated at that time.

she had a four-day stay in the ccu when she was able to be
taken off the balloon pump and ventilatory support.  she did
have an episode of acute hypoxia after transfer to the floor
that improved with diuresis and nitrates.  she was discharged
two weeks to this current admission to a nursing home.

on presentation to the emergency department the patient had a
heart rate of around 100, and systolic blood pressure in the
80-90s.  hematocrit was down to 24.5.  hematocrit on
discharge from her prior hospitalization was 33; however, her
baseline hematocrit is in the mid 20s.  she was transfused 1
u of packed red blood cells in the emergency department.  she
had no electrocardiogram changes on arrival to the emergency
department.

upon arrival to the floor, she had acute decrease in oxygen
saturations to the low 80s with tachypnea and tachycardia to
the 150s.  she was given intravenous nitroglycerin drip,
intravenous lasix, and intravenous lopressor 2.5 mg, as well
as iv morphine 2 mg.  her abg showed a ph of 7.19, and a pco2
of 48, and a po2 of 56.  the patient was intubated and
transferred to the ccu.  her electrocardiogram showed sinus
tachycardia with unchanged segment elevations in v2-v4
compared with baseline.  her chest x-ray was consistent with
increasing congestive heart failure compared with earlier in
the day.

past medical history:  1.  coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction in .  catheterization in
 with stent to the proximal to the left anterior
descending, and ptca to the ramus and diagonal, 80% proximal
right coronary artery lesion.  catheterization in 
showed 100% proximal left anterior descending in stent
stenosis, and ptca was performed, as well as 100% om1 lesion,
as well as an 80% ramus lesion which was stented.
catheterization was complicated by hypotension and
respiratory distress as described in the hpi.  2.  systolic
dysfunction a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20-25% by
echocardiogram earlier this month showing mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy as well.  echocardiogram also showed
near akinesis of the entire septum and anterior wall of the
left ventricle, as well as distal inferior and distal lateral
wall akinesis.  the apex was aneurysmal as well.  3.
hypertension.  4.  history of gi bleed.  the patient had an
admission during  for gi bleed.  5.  autoimmune
hemolytic anemia followed by hematology/oncology at  diagnosed in .
6.  diabetes mellitus thought to be steroid induced.  7.
hypothyroidism.

allergies:  no known drug allergies.

social history:  the patient resides at  nursing home.
denies tobacco.  occasional alcohol.  she is a retired hair
dresser.

physical examination:  vital signs:  on admission temperature
was 100.0??????, heart rate 100, blood pressure 118/51, oxygen
saturation 100% on 60% fio2 on vent setting ac 12 x 550 fio2
60% .............. to 7.5.  general:  the patient was
intubated, awake, responsive.  the patient was in no acute
distress.  cardiovascular:  regular, rate and rhythm.  no
murmurs.  audible over breath sounds.  respirations:  diffuse
anterior crackles.  extremities:  trace bilateral lower
extremity edema.  abdomen:  positive bowel sounds.  soft,
nontender, nondistended.  guaiac negative in the emergency
department.  neck:  there was 9 cm jvp.

laboratory data:  white count 12.4, hematocrit 29.4 up from
24.5 in the emergency department, platelet count 290; inr
1.1, ptt 23.4; potassium 3.4, bun 28, creatinine 1.4, glucose
172, magnesium 1.7, albumin 3.1; cks serially 41, 36, 39,
troponin 1.3 on the morning of admission.

assessment:  this was an 83-year-old woman with known
congestive heart failure and ischemic coronary disease
presenting flash pulmonary edema in the setting of blood
transfusion.

hospital course:  1.  cardiovascular/ischemia:  the patient
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization while intubated.
the catheterization showed instant restenosis of her left
anterior descending stent at 40%; however, distal to the
stent, there was an 80% focal lesion which was ballooned and
stented.  her ramus stent were patent with associated ostial 40%
lesion.  her known 80% right coronary artery lesion remained
unchanged.  right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary wedge
pressure of 30, ra pressure of 12, pa pressure of 61/34, rv
pressure of 61/16. cardiac output was 4.4 with an index of 2.9.
mixed venous saturation in the catheterization lab was 57.6 from
the pulmonary artery.

the patient did well postcatheterization and was able to be
extubated.  she was placed on aspirin and plavix for life.
beta-blocker was re-added, and lopressor was titrated up 50
mg b.i.d.  ace inhibitor was also added.  her statin was
continued as well.  she remained chest-pain free and free of
shortness of breath throughout the rest of her
hospitalization.

2.  cardiovascular/pump:  the patient's ejection fraction was
known to be 20%.  heart catheterization confirmed her fluid
overload and congestive heart failure physiology.  she did
not respond to lasix on initially arriving in the ccu;
however after catheterization, she diuresed well to lasix
with general improvement in her pa diastolics and improvement
of her kidney function.  she was able to be extubated without
difficulty after adequate diuresis was achieved.

upon arrival to the floor from the ccu, the chf service was
consulted.  they recommended initiating digoxin, low-dose
nitrate, and standing p.o. lasix which was done.  she was
discharged with plans to follow-up with the chf service for
continued medical management of her congestive heart failure.

3.  pulmonary:  the patient was able to be initially
extubated on the second hospital day; however, on the day
after initial extubation, her status remained tenuous with
increasing nitroglycerin drip and p.r.n. morphine required to
reduce her preload enough to maintain oxygenation.  on the
night after initial extubation, she required emergent
reintubation due to acute hypoxia.  chest x-ray prior to
intubation demonstrated white-out of the lower two-thirds of
the right lung; however, film 3-4 hours postintubation showed
resolution of the opacity throughout the right lung
consistent with acute mucous plugging.  it was therefore
thought that that episode of hypoxia was not due to
congestive heart failure but to mucous plugging.  the patient
was reextubated without difficulty status post
catheterization and maintained satisfactory oxygenation
throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.

she was also started on levofloxacin on admission due to
suspicion of right upper lobe infiltrate.  levofloxacin was
switched to ceftriaxone and azithromycin on the third
hospital day.  she remained afebrile throughout her hospital
course but did however start to develop a cough toward the
end of her hospital stay.  she was continued on the
ceftriaxone through the hospital stay with the plan for a
total 14-day course along with her azithromycin.

4.  infectious disease:  as above, the patient was treated
for suspicion of pneumonia.  of note, she had an isolated
positive blood culture growing gram-positive cocci in pairs
and clusters from ; however, she was afebrile
throughout the time surrounding this culture.  repeat
cultures were drawn on , and were pending at
the time of this dictation.

5.  heme:  the patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic
anemia with a baseline hematocrit in the mid 20s.  as noted
in the hpi, she was transfused 1 u prior to her episode of
flash pulmonary edema.  hematology service was , and
they felt that it would be acceptable to transfuse the
patient as needed.  the patient was transfused with one
additional unit of blood during her hospital stay.  due to
her steroids and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, she was
restarted on stress dose steroids as she had been on her
previous admission.  these were quickly tapered to a
discharge dose of prednisone 10 mg q.d.  the patient had
stable blood pressure and hematocrit on this dose.

6.  fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  the patient
developed hypernatremia toward the end of her hospital stay
with a peak sodium of 151.  it was thought that this was due
to inadequate p.o. intake and free-water intake, and she was
encouraged to maintain p.o. intake.  a nutrition consult was
obtained as well.  follow-up labs of her sodium were pending
at the time of this dictation.

disposition:  the patient was discharged to acute
rehabilitation in stable condition.

v2-v5/elevation in iii and negative ce??????s. admitted with acs and
sent directly to cath. tnts drawn post cath and positive, but
trended down ( pci?). ck??????s were flat. thus, was unclear where

cabg at a future date. of note, after cath, the patient was
extremely sleepy and had rr of 8. he was sent to the icu for
monitoring, but was lucid and stable within 8-10 hrs. his
sleepiness was attributed to the large amount of sedatives,
opioids that he received at the osh and intracath. he was not
given narcan. he was stable and cp free for the remainder of his
admission. continuous telemetry monitoring revealed sr

beta blockade, lasix, hydralazine, imdur, metolazone)
complicated by chronic kidney disease (stage iv), ef of 25-30%,
obesity, and
tobacco abuse.  he presented today to the emergency room after
 clinic noted severe bilateral papilledema; opthomology
suggested this was secondary to either elevated intracranial
pressure in the setting of malignant hypertension or pseudotumor
cerebri.  he has been symptomatic with blurry vision over the
past month in the absence of headaches or other central
symptoms.  he has noted some gait instability. in the ed, his
blood pressure was noted to be 180/118.  he took his usual dose
of one of his blood pressure meds (unknown) and his bp improved
to 160 systolic.  he was transferred to the micu for management
of hypertensive emergency.

imaging:

ct head w/o contrast :
1. no acute intracranial pathology.
2. bilateral proptosis.

renal u/s :
both kidneys show increased echogenicity consistent with chronic

kidney disease. two simple cysts in the right kidney, one at the
upper pole and one at the lower pole. doppler evaluation of both
renal arteries and of the arcuate/segmental vessels in the renal
parenchyma was within normal limits. no ultrasound/doppler
evidence for renal artery stenosis.

tte :
the left atrium is mildly dilated. the right atrium is
moderately dilated. the estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmhg. there is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (lvef 50%).
tissue doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (pcwp>18mmhg). the right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
depressed free wall contractility. the ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. the aortic arch is mildly dilated. the aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. the
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. the pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. there is no pericardial effusion.


brief hospital course:
#hypertensive emergency:  pt presented with htn systolics >200
and blurry vision, found to have papilledema. the patient's
blood pressure was markedly elevated with systolic blood
pressures ranging from 160-210 during icu stay.  review of prior
notes outlines a longstanding history of poorly controlled blood
pressures.  his home isosorbide and carvedilol were
discontinued. labetalol was uptitrated to 200mg tid, hydral
downtitrated to 50mg tid, clonidine 0.3mg weekly patch started,
and furosemide/metolazone continued as is. map >120 was goal. on
leaving the icu spb was in 130s. tsh was within normal limits.
it was felt that this patient needed a full workup for secondary
causes of hypertension. in the meantime renal artery ultrasound
done here showed no renal artery stenosis but did show chornic
bilateral changes consistent with ckdd. he should likely have a
workup for hyperaldosteronism (see hypokalemia below) and workup
including urine metanephrines and dexamethasone suppression
test, as he is quite young for this degree of hypertension and
seems to be compliant with his medications. he was initially
started on spironolactone given report of ef 25-30% and thought
that it may help with hypokalemia, however after 3 days (3
doses) this was discontinued so that pt could ideally have a
renin/aldosterone level drawn prior to discharge (which is now
pending), several days after discontinuation. would recommend
restarting this medication after the appropriate studies have
been done. it is more than likely this patient has sleep apnea
as well; in the icu he was noted to have desats during sleep
with very loud snoring. desats resolved instantly on waking. pt
is also smoking and quite obese both of which are likely
worsening his hypertension. would recommend outpatient sleep
study as well.
.
#hypokalemia - pt was noted to be hypokalemic with potassium
2.9-3.2. concern for hyperaldosterone state given concommittant
resistant hypertension. pt required >160meq potassium repletion
per day while in the  and still remained with k below 4.0.
outpatient records demonstrate history of low potassium. pt also
had been started on spironolactone, and while it was low dose,
it did not appear to help with potassium retention. this was
also unusual in the setting of elevated creatinine/chronic renal
failure, which emphasized concerns for hyperaldosterone state.
spironolactone was dcd temporarily so that he could have
renin/ levels drawn.

#intracranial hypertension: likely secondary to systmemic
hypertension.  neurology evalauted patient in ed and suggested
potential lp if bp controlled to assess for pseudotumor
cerebrii, though this can be deferred to outpatient setting if
papilledema does not improve with improved bp control.
.
#chronic kidney disease: the patient's creatinine was elevated
at 3.6-3.7, which is baseline. ckd likely secondary to
hypertensive nephropathy.  continued sevalamer and nephrocaps.
.
#chronic systolic chf: no echo in the system, but osh records
per dr. note states tte showed increased wall
thickness, estimated lvef 25-30% and global hypokinesis without
focal wall motion abnormality, as well as increased 
, with estimated pa systolic pressure 32mm.  the
patient appeared euvolemic on exam, without evidence of an acute
schf exacerbation.  his blood pressure control was adjusted as
above, including the addition of spironolactone to his regimen.
despite his renal impairment, he may benefit from the addition
of an acei/ and should discuss this with his pcp,
, and nephrologist.  he was continued on a beta
blocker (though switched from metoprolol/carvedilol to
labetalol), lasix, and metolazone. his ef on the tte here showed
an ef of 55%.

transitional issues:
-has pcp, , and nephrology follow-up scheduled
-needs outpatient sleep study
-would benefit from work-up for secondary hypertension if not
already done at another facility - follow up renin/ ratio,
may draw urine metaneprhines, dex suppression testing
-patient was a full code during this admission
-would benefit from nutrition consult
- has cr and k ordered as outpt on  which needs f/up

discharge instructions:
dear mr. ,

you were admitted to the intensive care unit at  with very high blood pressures and
blurry vision.  your blurry vision was likely caused by your
high blood pressure.  when your blood pressure is this high, you
are at risk for serious complications including further kidney
damage and possible stroke.  we monitored you closely and
changed some of your blood pressure medications to help better
control your blood pressures.

we made the following changes to your medications:
stopped:
-carvedilol
-metoprolol
-isosorbide mononitrate

decreased:
-hydralazine from 100 mg three times a day to 50 mg three times
a day

increased:
-potassium chloride 20 meq chrystals increased from one dose
once a day to two doses once a day

started:
-clonidine patch 0.3 mg once a week
-labetalol 400 mg three times a day
-lisinopril 2.5mg once a day

we did not make any other changes to your medications.  please
continue to take them as you have been doing.

it is very important that you take your blood pressure
medications and monitor your blood pressure.  if your blood
pressure is persistently higher than 190/110, you should contact
your doctor.  also, if you develop any worsening blurry vision,
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or
weakness on one side of the face or body, you should seek
medical attention immediately.

we are concerned you may have a condition called obstructive
sleep apnea, and we recommend you have a sleep study after you
leave the hospital.

we also recommend that you see a nutritionist and work on
continuing to lose weight.  please eat a low salt diet.

we also strongly encourage you to stop smoking.

please also note that you will need to get your creatinine and
potassium checked on , .

waiting list with recent evaluation by dr. ,  her
partner.   reports taking 120 mg of xanax and 80 mg
klonopin in the afternoon of  as well as at least 
g of tylenol daily over the last 2 weeks.  she also admitted to
taking 20 mg of ambien.  she says that she was taking the
tylenol intentionally to worsen her liver function.  she says
that she decided to do this because she wanted to commit
suicide.  she also reports having had 1 glass of wine on the day
of these medication ingestions.  she then called one of her

history of present illness:  the patient is an 88-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease now with
bradycardia.  he had an episode of dizziness when walking
today.  his wife took his pulse and noticed it was slow.
the patient reportedly had some relief from his symptoms
after his wife gave him a sublingual nitroglycerin.  he
subsequently had a second episode of dizziness at rest and
went to the emergency department.

there, he was found to have a pulse of 30 without p waves.
external pacing was attempted and unsuccessful capturing.
atropine was given without effect.  he was started on
dopamine 10 mcg per minute and noted to revert to sinus at 50
beats per minute then hypertension to the 200s.

the patient was reportedly still complaining of dizziness
while in sinus.  he denied chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, and palpitations.

he had an exercise treadmill test on  which
was stopped for shortness of breath with no st segment
changes.  rhythm was sinus with rare isolated aea and vea
with blood pressure responsive flat.  nuclear images with
moderate defects, apex with ejection fraction of 65% and mild
apical hypokinesis.

past medical history:
 1.  coronary artery disease; in  with 20% left
main coronary artery, a dv left anterior descending with
noncritical stenosis and widely patent stent in the proximal
segment.  first obtuse marginal with critical lesion.  left
circumflex with mild luminal irregularities and 40% proximal
right coronary artery.  mild diastolic function with ejection
fraction of 60% with a normal wall motion.
 2.  hepatitis c virus.
 3.  hypertension.
 4.  nocturia.
 5.  osteoarthritis.
 6.  ventral hernia.
 7.  cholelithiasis; status post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.
 8.  colon cancer; status post colectomy in .
 9.  positive purified protein derivative.
10.  cervical degenerative joint disease.

allergies:  he has no known drug allergies.

medications on admission:
1.  aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  atorvastatin p.o. q.d.
4.  doxazosin p.o. q.h.s.
5.  zoloxafed 200 p.m.
6.  tolterodine 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  losartan 80 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  diphenhydramine 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.
9.  glucosamine 500 mg p.o. q.d.

physical examination on presentation:  on physical
examination, his pulse was 35, blood pressure was 100/42,
respiratory rate was 22.  he was 91% on room air.  in
general, he was lying with the head of the bed at 20 degrees,
in no acute distress.  his pupils were equally round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  extraocular motions
were intact.  oral mucous membranes were dry.  jugular venous
distention was difficult to assess secondary to constant head
and oral movement.  he was bradycardic with a normal s1 and
s2.  no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  his lungs were clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  his abdomen with a prominent
ventral hernia was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  normal
active bowel sounds.  his extremities showed 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally with no pitting edema.

pertinent laboratory values on presentation:  white blood
cell count was 7.8, hematocrit was 42.6, and platelets were
180.  prothrombin time was 12.9, partial thromboplastin time
was 24.2, inr was 1.1.  sodium was 145, potassium was 5.1,
chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was
22, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 115.  ck was
63.  troponin was less than 0.3.  calcium was 9.9, magnesium
was 1.9, phosphate was 5.2.

radiology/imaging:  electrocardiogram showed junctional
bradycardia at 36 beats per minute with left axis with waves
in iii and avf and inverted t waves in iii with no st segment
changes.

electrocardiogram after dopamine showed a normal sinus rhythm
at 61 beats per minute, a left axis, high-normal p-r
interval, q waves in iii and avf, t wave flattening in iii,
and no st segment changes.

hospital course:  he was admitted to the coronary care unit
as a percutaneous wire was unable to capture and v-pace.

his heart rate was maintained on dopamine.  his rhythm was
found to be an atrial exit block, likely the cause of his
dizziness.  he was evaluated by electrophysiology and was
sent for pacemaker placement.

on the second night of admission he was complaining of
insomnia and was given ambien and became very agitated.  at
that time, he pulled out his right internal jugular cordis.
two hours after replaced, he received 2 mg of intravenous
haloperidol for the confusion and seemed to calm down.  it
was thought to be secondary to the ambien which was
discontinued.  he had no further episodes of hallucinations
or agitation at that time.

his creatinine improved with hydration to his baseline of
around 0.8.  he was maintained on his outpatient medications
for bph and osteoarthritis.

he received a pacemaker on  without
complications.  his hematocrit remained stable.  he had
received three doses of vancomycin perioperatively.  his beta
blocker and angiotensin receptor blocker were resumed as they
had previously been held while on dopamine and also with his
tendency for bradycardia.  these were resumed without issue.

the only complicating factor was he was slightly nauseated
with vomiting after returning from his procedure.  it was
thought this was likely due to the sedation.  he was given
antiemetics, and it resolved the following day when the
sedation wore off.

he was able to eat and ambulate without dizziness or concern.
therefore, he was discharged home in good condition.

medications on discharge:
1.  aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  atorvastatin p.o. q.d.
4.  doxazosin p.o. q.h.s.
5.  zoloxafed 200 p.m.
6.  tolterodine 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  losartan 80 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  diphenhydramine 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.
9.  glucosamine 500 mg p.o. q.d.

of note, it should be noted that the patient should not be
given ambien as it causes agitation and delirium.

discharge instructions/followup:  he was to follow up with
the electrophysiology clinic.

history of present illness:
mr.  is a 67m with hiv (cd4 183, vl 96 copies/ml) and end
stage copd on 3-4l home o2 with a fev1 of 0.5 who presented to
the emergency room on  with increased shortness of
breath. three days prior to presentation he developed nasal
congestion and rhinorrhea which made it difficult for him to use
his supplemental oxygen at home. he had subjective fevers and
chills but did not check his temperature. he had minimal cough
productive of dark yellow sputum. he was feeling more short of
breath despite increasing oxygen use. he was concerned about
pneumonia and presented to the emergency room.
.
in the emergency room his initial vitals were t: 98.1 hr: 86 rr:
107/72 rr: 22 o2: 100% on ra. he had a chest xray which showed
significant hyperinflation but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
he received levofloxacin 750 mg iv x 1, duonebs, solumedrol 125
mg iv x 1 and aspirin 81 mg. he was initially admitted to the
floor.
.
while on the floor he was started on azithromycin, solumedrol
125 mg iv tid, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers. he did well
on hospital day 1 but overnight his shortness of breath
worsened. he had a repeat cxr which was similar to priors. he
had an abg on a non-rebreather which was 7.37/57/207/34. he had
increased work of breathing and asked to be placed on a machine
for breathing. he is transferred to the micu for non-invasive
ventilatory support.
n the micu he was intubated an an a-line was placed due to
increased
wob. blood pressure was elevated while in respiratory distress
and he was treated with hydralazine. he had one episode of
hypotension responsive to ivf. a right ij central line placed.
abg on  was 7.32/54/104. methylprednisolone was decreased to
60mg iv bid. he was extubated on icu day 3 and initially
appeared in stress but did well after small dose iv morphine.he
was transferred to the floor on icu day 4. prior to transfer he
reviewed his code status and decided to be dnr/dni.
.
on the floor, he is doing relatively well. he reports he is
still somewhat short of breath but not in any distress. he
reports back pain secondary to old back injury. he will be
spending time with family and friends who are coming in from
around the country to see him. reports lack of appetite but no
n/v. denies f/c cough, chest pain.

brief hospital course:
in summary, mr.  is a 67m with hiv (on haart) and
end-stage copd (on home o2), who presented  with
worsening shortness of breath in the setting of likely 
transferred to micu for worsening respiratory distress.
.
# end-stage copd/respiratory distress: end-stage baseline copd
(fev1 20% predicted and on home o2). admitted w likely copd
exacerbation triggered by viral uri. nasal complaints and
absence of infiltrate go against a bacterial pna. mi and pe also
considered. pt treated with nebulizers, steroids, azithromycin.
abg shows chronic respiratory acidosis which appears
compensated. pt oxygenated well on o2 by nasal canula, but
developed respiratory distress w accessory muscle use, tachypnea
and tachycardia, which required micu transfer on  for
increasing respiratory distress.  he was subsequently intubated
that same night as his respiratory status continued to worsen.
he remained stable on the vent and was extubated without
complications on .  his respiratory status continued to be
stable post-extubation.  he was continued on azithromycin for a
three day course and continued on steroids.  he was then
transferred back to the medical floor the following day after
extubation with stable respiratory status.  followed by dr
.  on the floor his steroid regimen was kept as iv until
patient's sbo resolved.  with resolution of sbo patient was
transitioned to po steroids.  pt was discharged with a steroid
taper.  his last dose of prednisone 10mg .
.
on the floor his dyspnea continued and he required 4-5 l of
nasal o2. he was evaluated by palliative care after he made the
decision to become dnr/dni. based on their recommendations he
was switched from atc morphine to ms contin and ativan for
dyspnea related anxiety. he was noted to have mental status
changes including confusion, somnolence so ms contin was
discontinued with return to normal mentation. his respiratory
continued to improve with decrease in anxiety noted.  patient's
pain was well controlled with liquid morphine, fentanyl patch,
and tylenol #3 as needed.
.
# hiv/aids: patient on haart with recent decrease in cd4 count
to below 200, hence on bactrim ppx. followed by dr . haart
was temporarily discontinued in the setting of sbo with nausea
and vomiting. with resolution of sbo, haart was restarted on
.
.
#small bowel obstruction: patient developed acutely worsening
abdominal pain on the  associated with nausea and vomiting.
ct of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a partial sbo. he was
made npo and a nasogastric tube was placed.  patient's nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal distention improved steadily.  his ngt
was clamped and eventually discontinued on  with advancement
of his diet to a regular diet.  he tolerated that well.
.
#pneumonia: patient was found to have a left lower lobe
pneumonia incidentally on chest xray evaluating picc placement.
labs at the time were remarkable for leukocytosis. he was
started on zosyn and vancomycin for presumed hospital associated
pneumonia.  patient's vancomycin was stopped on .  he was
continued on zosyn and then transitioned to po levoquin on 
and discharged on this medication to complete an 8 day course of
antibiotics with last day of antibiotics to be .
.
# hypertension: normotensive on admission, mild elevation in
blood pressures in the setting of respiratory distress.  patient
was continued on his home dose of doxazosin while in house.
.
# gerd: stable. continued h2 blocker.
.
# anemia: hematocrit dropped slightly during hospital admission
from patient's baseline of 36 to 22.  iron studies demonstrated
most likely anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia
coupled with dilutional effect of iv hydration and daily blood
draws as reasonable explanation of drop in hematocrit.  patient
was always hemodynamically stable with no signs or symptoms of
active bleeding.  patient was started on po iron.

69 yo m h/o hiv, copd presenting with shortness of breath and
not feeling well. he was notably just admitted to  for a
copd exacerbation . during this admission he was noted to
have a tenuous respiratory status with poor air movement and was
briefly intubated for a few hours. he was started on steroids
with a slow taper and azithromycin. since his discharge he did
not feel well and came to  for further evaluation.

in the ed, initial vs were: 97.9 103 170/105 27 99% 3l. he was
noted to have poor air movement and given 125 mg iv solumedrol
and duonebs. bipap started, however patient vomited, so this was
stopped. he was given iv zofran and phenergan. abg was
7.37/58/96, so once his nausea resolved, he was placed back on
bipap. he was notably tachycardic to the 180s which was felt to
be afib vs. mat. he was given 15 mg iv diltiazem and broke soon
after this. he was notably also given morphine and ativan. cxr

severe emphysema and bronchiectasis. fev1: 20% in spirometry
 c/w end stage disease.  patient was intermittently treated
with bipap in icu, however his oxygen saturation was good and he
often requested bipap for only short amounts of time prior to
removing bipap. mr.  was started on methylprednisolone 125
mg iv q6h for the first day of admission and then was
transitioned to prednisone 60 mg daily.  he will continue on a
slow prednisone taper.  he was also treated with a 5 day course
of levofloxacin 750 mg.  patient was treated with duonebs and
received ativan and oxycodone for dyspnea.  he was started on
bactrim, famotidine, and calc/vit d for prophylaxis for presumed
long term steroids.

# multifocal atrial tachycardia: patient was noted to have
multifocal atrial tachycardia ed, resolved prior to admission to
icu. likley secondary to underlying copd.  patient's copd was
controlled and he did not have multifocal atrial tachycardia
while in icu.  diltiazem was started at 30mg tid for hr control
with hrs < 100.

the patient had been recently admitted 5/13-16/ for copd
exacerbation and treated with nebs, azithromycin, prednisone
(slow taper). the patient presented to the ed on  for
dyspnea but left ama before admission. he was sent to the ed on
 but left ama again, with prednisone and azithromycin
prescriptions which he never filled. he had seen dr.  in
pulmonary clinic yesterday and had been non-compliant with
prednisone taper. he endorsed exhaustion at the appointment
but was stable 93% on 3.5l nasal cannula. the patient had also
been at  clinic with dr.  prior to pulmonary
appointment.
.
the patient re-presented to the ed today with worsening dyspnea
and was brought in by ems in respiratory distress (enroute co2
50). he responded to nebulizers enroute and arrived looking very
uncomfortable, using accessory muscles. he was tight on
pulmonary exam with minimal breath sounds and speaking few word
sentences. the patient was started on bipap (50%, psv 15, peep
5), which he tolerated well. he was briefly weaned off to 4l nc

brief hospital course:
69 year old male with history of hiv (cd4 116 ), copd
(2-4l at home), dvt on coumadin, hypertension, chronic lower
back , osteoporosis who presents with respiratory distress.

.
# respiratory distress: most likely due to ongoing copd
exacerbation. trigger unclear given lack of pneumonia on initial
cxr, no fevers/chills, productive cough. patient has been
non-compliant with medications, however, since discharge; this
includes prednisone and antibiotics. ?compliance with nebulizers
and has supplemental o2 at home. the patient has had cta
recently to rule out pulmonary emboli given ongoing dyspnea
despite therapy. he was treated with azithromycin for 5 days and
methylprednisolone. he intermittently required bipap. a plan was
made to use bipap at night once the patient was able to leave
the icu. however on the morning of  patient was anxious,
tachypneic and desatted and required intubation.  the patient
was extubated on . he did well overnight but subsequently
had further respiratory distress and his steroids were increased
to full burst.  he ultimately decided to be dnr/dni and came to
the understanding that he wasn't going to get better; the
patient decided to become cmo and was discharged to home hospice
after discussing with palliative care in-house.
- continue long steroid taper at home (prednisone 60mg x 7 days,
40mg x 7 days, 20 mg x7 days, 10mg x 7 days, off)
- continue supplemental oxygen, albuterol and ipratropium nebs
- continue ms contin and morphine liquid prn for air hunger,
shortness of breath
- continue lorazepam prn for air hunger, shortness of breath,
anxiety
.
# hiv: down trending cd4 count, ?due to acute illness. continued
abacavir, lamivudine, fosamprenavir, and atazanavir. continued
bactrim ss daily. patient does have history of bactrim needing
to be held in  for bone marrow suppression. the need for
ongoing haart medication and pcp prophylaxis was discussed with
the patient. it was felt that he likely will not succumb to
hiv/aids or an opportunistic infection before he succumbs to his
end-stage copd. however, taking these medications are not a
hardship for the patient and he would prefer not to risk
increasing hiv viral load and chance of opportunistic infection,
especially in the setting of ongoing steroids.
- the patient will be discharged home on hospice with
continuation of his haart medications and bactrim pcp
.
.
# dvt: leni the day prior to admission as outpatient was
negative for dvt. patient has been therapeutic and followed by
 here at . he missed several doses of
coumadin in the settting of being on bipap and developed a
subtherapeutic inr. he was bridged with lovenox. anticoagulation
held  for concern for gib but coumadin was resumed when hct
was stable for 24 hrs. upon discharge home with hospice,
however, anticoagulation was discussed with the patient. as he
had a dvt in  and ultimately completed treatment but was
continued given his sedentary/immobile nature, the indication
for ongoing anticoagulation and risk of dvt/pe is not high.
- given this information, the patient chose to be discharged off
of coumadin. his primary care provider and the 
anticoagulation nurses were informed of his decision, and the
fact that he no longer needs inr checks.
.
#gib: patient noted to have guaic positive stool. t+s sent, ppi
started, picc placed, transfused 1 unit of blood but did not
bump appropriately, so given 2nd unit. hct then increased
appropriately and remained stable.
- ppi was stopped given the absence of frank melena on discharge
and to minimize medications for hospice.
.
# multifocal atrial tachycardia: seen in the ed during patient's
hospitalization . patient was started on diltiazem in
this setting but did not have mat last admission either. the
patient can continue on home diltiazem on discharge to prevent
discomfort from breakthrough tachycardia.
.
# anemia: slightly lower than baseline hct close to 30.
normocytic and previously thought due to chronic disease. haart
medications may be contributing to marrow suppression. in
addition, pt noted to have guaic positive stools which are
discussed above.
.
# hypertension: stable, mildly hypertensive, continued 
diltiazem and doxazosin. -- doxazosin was stopped on discharge
for hospice to streamline medications.
.
# osteoporosis: on calcium and vitamin d.
- these medications were stopped on discharge to streamline
medications.
.
# gerd: admitted on famotidine. stable, started on ppi as above
while intubated as famotidine can also interact with hiv
medications; also in setting of guaiac positive stools per
above.
- famotidine was stopped on discharge to streamline medications.
.
# other transitional issues:
- continue home o2 as prescribed
- oral suction as prescribed
- maintain picc with appropriate heparin flushes as a provision
for morphine infusion if patient's air hunger is refractory to
po morphine elixir and he requires iv morphine

brief hospital course:
ms.  was admitted under the acute care surgery service on
 for further evaluation and management of her injuries.
she was initially admitted to the trauma icu for close
monitoring given her rib fractures, and was transferred to the
floor on hd#1 as she remained stable.

neuro: she remained alert and oriented throughout her
hospitalization. her pain level was routinely assessed. she was
initially administered iv narcotics for pain control, and was
transitioned to an oral regimen when tolerating po's. prior to
discharge, she reported adequate pain control on an oral
regimen.

cv: her vital signs were monitored routinely and she remained
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. serial hct's were checked
given her liver lac, initially q6h on admission and then .
they remained stable, and she remained without evidence of blood
loss.

pulm: given the small size of her pneumothorax, no chest tube
placement was necessary. agressive pulmonary toileting and
incentive spirometry were encouraged. nebulizer treatments were
administered. her supplemental oxygen was able to be weaned.
prior to discharge, her oxygen saturation was within normal
limits on room air. she remained without respiratory compromise.

gi: she was initially kept npo with iv fluids for hydration and
an ng tube was placed on admission given her liver laceration.
her hematocrit remained stable and abdominal exam remained
benign, so the ng tube was removed on  and she was started on
clear liquids. her diet was slowly advanced over the next 24
hours and she was tolerating a regular diet at discharge. she
was started on a bowel regimen given her narcotic intake.

gu: a foley catheter was placed on admission. her intake and
output were closely monitored. on  it was removed and she
voided without difficulty.

musk: orthopedics was consulted given her pelvic fractures and
lumbar transverse process fractures. these injuries were
determined to be stable requiring no surgical intervention.
follow up in the orthopedic clinic was scheduled for 2 weeks
from discharge.

physical therapy was consulted to evaluate her mobility, given
her injuries determined she was best suited going to rehab. the
patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition, pain
controlled on oral medication, tolerating a regular diet, and
urinating without difficulty.

discharge instructions:
you were admitted to the hospital after being struck by a motor
vehicle.  as a result of this accident you sustained multiple
injuries as listed below.

your multiple rib fractures can cause severe pain and
subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the
pain.

*  you should take your pain medication as directed to stay
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep
breaths. if the pain medication is too sedating take half the
dose and notify your physician.

*  pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  in order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake.  this will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.

*  you will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing
and deep breathing.

*  symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.

*  narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.

*  do not smoke

*  if your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, ibuprofen, motrin,
advil, aleve, naprosyn) but they have their own set of side
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

*  return to the emergency room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs ( crepitus ).

history of present illness:
this 66 year old man has a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and obesity. he has been followed in the 
clinic for quite some time. over the summer the patient noticed
several episodes of bilateral shoulder discomfort while walking
up a slight incline on the golf course. these episodes would
resolve quickly with rest and then he would be able to continue
on with the rest of his game without symptoms.

several weeks ago the patient noticed similar bilateral shoulder
discomfort after walking only 100 feet.  he did not experience
any chest discomfort, shortness of breath or other associated
symptoms and again, after several minutes of rest his discomfort
resolved.

he sought consultation with dr.  who referred him for
stress testing. he exercised 8.25 minutes of   protocol,
reaching 79% of his maximum predicted heart rate. at peak
exercise there was diffuse 2.0-3.0 st segment depression in the
inferior leads and 1.0-2.0 mm depression in leads i and v3-v6.
the rhythm was sinus with apb??????s and one pvc. post exercise there
were frequent pvc??????s noted including ventricular bigeminy and
trigeminy. imaging revealed a mostly reversible perfusion defect
of the septum and apex. a fixed inferior wall defect was also
noted.  lvef was 48%. he is now referred for cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate.

radiology:
cxr : diffusely increased opacities at the lung fields
bilaterally. in an immunocompromised patient, this is concerning
for pcp . radiographically, the differential includes
pulmonary edema. additionally, there is a faint opacity at the
right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or focal
pneumonic process.
.
ct-head : focus of low attenuation within the subcortical
white matter of the right medial frontal lobe. this may
represent a subacute infarction; however, an underlying mass
lesion cannot be completely excluded. an mri examination with
gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for
further evaluation. no intracranial hemorrhage noted.
.
mr-head-w&w/o gadolinium :
signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving
the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. this
finding most likely represent a small infarct. however, in
absence of adc map, age of the infarct could not be determined.
no abnormal enhancement is seen. follow up is suggested, if
clinically indicated.
.
echo :
1.the left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. the left
ventricular cavity size is normal. regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (lvef>55%).
3. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. the aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. no masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. there is no aortic valve stenosis. trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. no mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. while difficult to
assess given the limited views suspect mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.there is no pericardial effusion.
.
if clinically indicated, would recommend a tee.
.
cxr :
resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
.
studies:
eeg : this is a mildly abnormal eeg due to the presence of
a slow
and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing -
all
consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or
anoxic
etiology. no evidence for ongoing seizures is seen.


brief hospital course:
a/p:  54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for uc (prednisone,
6mp) who presents with new onset ha, fever with bacterial
meningitis and gram positive rod bacteremia.
.
#. listeriosis - meningitis and bacteremia. patient presented
with headache, nuchal rigidity, expressive aphasia, afebrile on
admission but temp to 104.4 in the ed, where she also started to
have rigors.  lp showed >300 wbc, poly predominant with 5%
monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16.  csf gram stain showed gram
positive rods, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation
eventually grew listeria. empiric treatment based on gram stain
was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and
question of pcp,  below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending
confirmation of gram stain and culture results.  once
speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was
started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd.
bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for pcp
 , when it was changed to prophylaxis dose.  early on
admission, she developed hypotension that required levophed, but
was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of
admission with prbcs (total of 4 units) and volume
resussitation.  given bacteremia, tte was done, no vegetations
or lesions noted. head ct on admission showed right medial
frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, no hemorrhage.
subsequent mri confirmed infarct, unclear date, and eeg
consistent with meningitis.  neurology was consulted, and the
patient was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis given
meningoencephalitis. she spiked fevers to 101-102 over the first
several days of admission.  by , her neurological exam was
markedly improved, and by  her headache was gone, no
meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essential tremor
was slightly more severe. surveillance blood cultures reamined
negative from  on.  notably, she was transferred from icu
to floor on , but noninvasive bp was read as 60/d, patient
mentating well, sent back to icu. in the icu, an arterial line
was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmhg higher than
sphyngomanometer.  this discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but
persistent.  patient maintained normal mentation, good urine
output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear
reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points.  on
, she was sent to the floor for further care and management.
.
#. bilateral lung opacities/hypoxia. initial chest film read as
increased opacities bilaterally concerning for pcp (given
steroids and no pcp ) vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. pulmonary
edema. she had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her
respiratory distress led to her being placed on cpap+ps.  the
origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be
secondary to likely vascular leak from sepsis/chf versus pcp. 
induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not
repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and
susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of pcp was small.  she
responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced o2 requirements.
.
#. uc: she continued to receive her outpatient dose of
prednisone, which was changed on  to dexamethasone iv; her
outpatient 6-mp was held. after several days with no diarrhea,
it recurred on  soon after her diet had advanced. c.diff was
negative. she was made npo, and fed via tpn for bowel rest.  on
, it was noted that she began passing brbrp, her hematocrit
was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and
consent for blood transfusion.
.
#. anemia. on admission, she was found to be anemic. she
received prbcs for anemia on admission and again  for mixed
venous sat <70%.  she was found to have iron binding studies c/w
anemia of chronic disease.  her hct was followed closely, and
remained stable for the remainder of her admission.
.
#. fen: her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made npo
with tpn on  after she developed diarrhea, thought secondary
to continued uc activity.
.
#. prophylaxis: ppi. hold sq hep, pneumoboots. initially on
droplet precautions.
.
#. code status: full
.
#. communication: patient, her sister, brother, and mother
.
#. lines: peripheral iv x 2. left subclavian cc.  a-line. eval
for picc; once in place, can d/c central line, a-line.

surgery discharge part:
pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on
.  she was on clinda/gent peri-procedure and amplicillin
for 21 days at first.  she was seen by pt/ot and was npo until
the ostomy started to function.  she had c/o nausea as diet was
tolerated and it was slowed down.  mri was suspicious for an
abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6
weeks as per id.  she was given a picc.  on  she was
cleared by pt and was in good condition for d/c to rehab on

brief hospital course:
ms.  is a 61 yo w/ stage ii breast cancer who was
admitted on day 13 or cycle 2 of docetaxel (taxotere) +
cyclophosphomide who developed fever to 100.6 at home with
associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia.
.
#neutropenic fever- on presentation the pt's pmn count was 21
most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of
neulasta use. two possible sources of infection existed
including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered
while gardening. she was broadly covered with vancomycin and
cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to
cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased
ostomy output.  when cdiff returned negative, flagyl was
discontinued. blood cultures were sent and a u/a was not
concerning for infection. we also sent off galactomannan antigen
and beta-d-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic
fever workup which were negative. the following day after
admission her wbc rose significantly and she no longer was
neutropenic. as her wbc rose she started to develope a cough and
he cxr became concerning for an infiltrate. she was continued on
vanc/cefepime until afebrile and with anc>1000 for greater than
48 hours, after which she was switched to po levofloxacin to
complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.
.
# hypotension- in the  pt's sbp dropped to 70s, not responding
to ivf boluses. she refused central line placement in the ed and
peripheral pressors were initiated. this is most likely related
to her underlying infectious process. she was not administered
any medications recently that could be accounting for her
hypotension. looking through omr her baseline blood pressures
are sbp of 90s-100s. an a-line was obtained which showed higher
bp than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. she
was given several liters of iv fluid boluses and weaned off
pressors the night of admission to the icu. her cuff and a-line
pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line
was discontinued.
.
# breast cancer- currently in cycle 2 of docetaxel (taxotere) +
cyclophosphomide. most likely this current episode of
neutropenia is due to the fact that neulasta was not given
during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the
rapid rise in her wbc count myelosuppression from sepsis was
also a possibility.
.
# depression / anxiety- continue duloxetine and clonazepam at
home doses.
.
# nausea- continued compazine and po zofran prn.

medications on admission:
clonazepam - 1 mg tablet - 1 (one) tablet(s) by mouth once a day
anxiety
duloxetine [cymbalta] - 20 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.) - 2

discharge instructions:
dear ,

it was a pleasure to take care of you here at . you were
admitted for low white cell (neutrophil count), fever, and
pneumonia. you required monitoring with blood pressure
supporting medications and iv antibiotics in the intensive care
unit. fortunately, your counts improved and you responded nicely
to the antibiotics. please continue to take levofloxacin to
treat your pneumonia for a total of 8 days (last dose on
). as we discussed if you notice fever, worsening
breathing problems, or any other concerning symptoms to return
to the emergency room immediately.

we have made the following changes to your medications:

start levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for 4 more days
()

you should discuss with dr.  the possibility of restarting
neulasta with your next chemotherapy cycle.

major surgical or invasive procedure:
1. rigid bronchoscopy, debridement, t-tube placement.
2. baclofen pump removal.
3. ruq hematoma evacuation.
4. percutaneous gastrostomy tube.
5. left antecubital picc line.


history of present illness:
ms.  is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive ms
 in  with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump
placment in ', s/p tracheostomy in '  to chronic
respiratory weakness, recurrent utis, aspiration pnas, who
presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her
nursing home.  according to notes from , the
pt was found at her nursing home yesterday () am, shaking
her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed
seizure). she was taken by ems to  ed.
.
in the ed at , pts vitals were: tm 103.6, hr 110-150s rr
12-18 sao2 98-99%nrb. soon after, pt supposedly seized in the
ed, was given ativan, ambu'd and subsequently placed on simv
ventilation. pt was empirically started on vancomycin, levoquin,
ceftriaxone, bactrim and acyclovir. on exam, it was noted that
the skin overlying the baclofen pump (ruq) appeared inflamed.
labs were notable for a wbc of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia
of 20%. u/a with 50-100 wbc, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. lp
was performed and csf analysis showed 7,250 wbcs with 92% polys,
glucose 10, tp 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+
cocci. bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in  bottles. micro
lab performed latex agglutination on csf sample which was
positive for group b strep. vanc and ceftriaxone were dc'd and
ampicillin 2gm iv + benadryl given. hydrocortisone 80mg was also
given. left sc line and ngt were also placed at . cxr showed
cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. abdominal ct was negative for an
abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. head ct showed
questionable changes from prior that might suggest the
possibility of a right mca infarct. pt was transferred directly
to the  micu for further management.


past medical history:
pmh:
1. chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in  when pt
was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump (') for
spasticity

.
tte on admission:
1. left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (lvef>55%). regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. no obvious mass or vegetation seen.
.
ct abd post-op:
1) large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper
quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal
wall. no extension into the peritoneal space is seen. the
covering intern was notified by telephone at  a.m. on , .

2) gallbladder with dense material . this could represent
stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. if
clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further
characterization.

3) bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.

4) atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases.
.
eeg : this is a markedly abnormal portable eeg due to the

presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized
slowing
followed by periods of suppression. in addition, there were
independent
bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. this finding suggests deep,
midline
subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe
encephalopathy.
a repeat eeg may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of
the encephalopathy.
.
eeg : this is an abnormal portable eeg obtained in stage
ii sleep
with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of
intermittent and
independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both
sides.
this finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and
is
consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. in
addition,
exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the
underlying
infection.
.
mri : increased signal along the occipital horns could be
due to cellular debris from meningitis. no evidence of acute
infarct seen. mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild
communicating hydrocephalus.
.
mrv : the head mrv demonstrates normal flow signal in the
superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of
thrombosis. deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow
signal.
.
mra : somewhat limited mra of the head due to motion. no
evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
.
tee:
1.the left atrium is normal in size.
2. left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (lvef>55%).
3. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.there are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.the aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. no masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
6.the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. no mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve.
7.there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
head ct : stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.


brief hospital course:
1. gbs meningitis/bactermia
in the unit, the pt was continued on ampicillin and started on
gentamicin (for synergy). her intrathecal baclofen pump was
thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying
pump in ruq). pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the
operation appeared to be without complication. the following
day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be
hypotensive with an sbp of 70. after spiking a temp, it was
thought that she might be septic. she was given fluids, prbcs,
ffp, and placed on levophed. abd ct demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm
hematoma in the ruq at the former pump site. pt was taken
emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow
ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. she returned to
the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. given 1
additional unit of prbcs. her hct bumped appropriately and
remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. pt
developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought
to be  to pcn allergy. amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly
with vanc and then changed permanently to cefrtriaxone. repeat
lp was performed since the pt continued to be minimially
responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). csf
analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. prior to
leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. she was pancultured
and all cultures were negative. a tte ruled out endocarditis in
the setting of group b strep bacteremia.  on day #12 of
gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of
her treatment course.
.
2. ruq hematoma: as above, after the removal of the baclofen
pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to
be bleeding into the ruq pocket.  she was taken to the or for
emergent evacuation of the hematoma.  on pod #16, pt was noted
to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her ruq.
neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal
ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the ruq hematoma but
found a new fluid collection.  surgery was consulted and they
diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given
that it had no signs of infection.
.
3. pneumonia:
towards the end of the pt's icu stay, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the
passy-muir valve.  she underwent bronchoscopy and bal was sent
for culture.  the culture returned positive for mrsa and gram
negative rods (not pseudomonas).  she was started on vancomycin
for mrsa and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the gnr.
once the gnr sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas,
ceftaz was stopped.  of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that
were persistently high.  vancomycin troughs should be checked
often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.  after the
pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased
secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was
assumed that the pt aspirated.  that day she also spiked a
temperature to 100 so flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
vancomycin and levaquin will be finished on  (14-day course)
and flagyl's course will be complete on  (after 10 days).
.
4. supraglottic edema
as above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she
failed a passy-muir valve.  on bronchoscopy it was noted that
she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and
the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.  she was
taken to the or two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where
her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.
ent evaluated the patient and recommended a ct of the trachea to
evaluate her anatomy.  the ct showed tracheal bronchomalacia and
narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.  ideally, she
will get surgery by ent to improve her subglottic edema when the
patient has recovered from her acute illnesses.
.
5. anemia: iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct
drop after the bleed in the ruq pocket, pt's hct remained
stable.
.
6. multiple sclerosis
pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. she was
without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr hr, temp, bp,
seizures) once pump was removed. she continued on baclofen 20mg
qid po with an ativan taper. po baclofen was then tapered to
20mg tid.
.
7. mental status
at baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by ms, she
is alert, oriented, and conversant. her decreased responsiveness
was thought to be  to meningitis, but although pt seemed to
have resolving temp and wbc with abx, her diminished
reponsiveness persisted. repeat lp in the unit suggested a
resolving meningitis.  neurology was following the pt and
recommended an mri to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke
at osh) an mrv to rule out sinus thrombosis and an eeg to rule
out subclinical seizures.  an eeg on hd #3 was consistent with
severe encephalopathy and an eeg on hd #6 was consistent with
meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.  an mri was
finally done on hd #10 and showed mild communicating
hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and
eventually returned to her baseline mental status.  pt's mental
status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology
as an outpatient.
.
8. respiratory status
after a supposed seizure at osh pt was mechanically ventilated
thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (at
baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis
but does not require mechical ventilation. trach in place to
help with clearance of secretions.)  pt placed on a/c in unit,
then transferred to cpap and eventually placed on a trach mask
with good results.  at time of discharge, she was satting well
on 40% trach mask.
.
9. htn
in unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay
became hypertensive with sbps in the 150-170s. pt has hx of
hypertension. unclear whether bp was rebounding from baclofen
d/c. bp became well-controlled with systolic bp in the 90s-110s
on standing doses of lisinopril 20mg po, metoprolol 25mg .
.
10. sacral decub ulcer: stage 1-2.  wound care nurse followed
while pt was in-house.
.
11. fen: during pt's acute illness, she had an ngt placed.
speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids
and pureed food.  the following day, she was noted to have soup
coming out of her trach so she was again made npo.  pt then
passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration
after trying some ground solids.  she was made npo and gi placed
a peg for feeding.  pt should remain on tube feeds until her
tracheal swelling is much improved.  at that point, another
swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po
feeding.

conclusions:
there is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the
left ventricular cavity size is normal. there is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
, left ventricular dysfunction is new and mild aortic
regurgitation
is now detected.

brief hospital course:
a/p: 63 yo male with cardiac arrest  paroxysmal high degree
av block, s/p collapse with pea arrest now with temp pacer
transferred to  for further mgmt and permanent pacemaker
placement.
.
1. rhythm: paroxysmal high degree block, temp pacer placed.
reasons for initial collapse are unclear, possibly combination
of high degree av block and electrolyte disturbances, since
patient was on many k+sparing diuretics.  tele after admission
showed v-paced with few pvcs.  pt underwent pacemaker placement
on  without complications.  the next day device
interrigation was satisfacotory.  cxr did not show a
pneumothorax or any acute processes.  pt remained without
complaints and was discharged on .  indications for
pacer was symptomatic with high degree block.
.
2. coronaries: risk factors,  risk 17%, ruled out for
mi w/trop leak but flat cks after arrest. -cont asa, bb, statin
- lipids checked : total chol 122, hdl 36, ldl 68.  continued on
lipitor 20.
- initially held acei given  upto creatinine of 2.2.  given
his hyperkalemia on presentation pt was not restarted on ace
inhibitors as his bp was well controlled.
- repeat echo (see below) showed ef of 50%.  given this event
would recommend an outpatient evaluation by cardiologist for
likely exercise stress test.
.
3. pump: ef  was 60% w/lae, likely diastolic dysfunction,
mild hypervolemia w/?mild pulm edema causing mild hypoxia,
initially gentle diuresis with goals -500cc to -1l.
- continued amlodipine and metoprolol for rate control
- held ace/arbs due to

discharge instructions:
you have had a pacemaker placed because of electrical block in
your heart. this may have been precipitated by kidney failure
and too much potassium in your blood. do not take the
medications you were taking prior to this event. we have
enclosed a list of and prescriptions for your new medication
needs. please take these as directed and discuss any changes
with your primary care doctor.
.
you have many risks for coronary heart disease. we feel you need
a stress test with imaging in the next month to make sure that
you do not have any significant need for a cardiac
catheterization. until then, taking aspirin, your toprol xl
(beta blocker safe in renal failure), your lipitor, and
eventually starting your lisinopril again will protect you
somewhat from heart attacks.
.
you must never take nsaid medications again. your kidney disease
makes this dangerous. avoid ibuprofen, advil, motrin, aleve,
naproxen, or ketoprofen. talk with your doctor   if
you are unsure about any medications you are taking.


followup instructions:
1. see your primary care doctor dr.  on  28th at
 to check your potassium and creatinine levels and to
discuss everything we recommended. have your doctor follow up on
the serum and urine protein electrophoresis that was pending
when you were discharged as well as the final report of your
echocardiogram. talk with your doctor about your anemia and
whether or not you would need a bone marrow biopsy.

2. go to the pacemaker device clinic 


3. you should see our nephrologists sometime for your kidney
disease. talk with your primary doctor about this and call for
an appointment .

4. you should also setup an appointment with a cardiologist to
have a exercise stress test done as outpatient.  you can speak
with your pcp regarding  cardiologist or you can call  at  to setup an appointment here.

pertinent results:
ct head:
extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. recommend head cta
to evaluate for an intracranial aneurysm.
findings were discussed with dr.

cta:
findings: there is a 3 mm x 3 mm saccular outpouching from the
region of the anterior communicating artery , consistent
with aneurysm. this has a very narrow neck, and would be
amenable to endovascular intervention. no other aneurysm or
vascular abnormality is seen.
there is stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery.
otherwise, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major
branches are patent, with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
the distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm on
the right, and 5 mm on the left.
mild-to-moderate multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes
are noted.
impression: 3 mm saccular aneurysm arising from the anterior
communicating
artery, with narrow neck.


brief hospital course:
mr.  was admited on  and became increasingly
lethargic and transferred to the icu for further care under the
neurosurgery service. a diagnostic cta revealed a large acom
aneursym which was coiled the following day.

post coiling the pt. was admitted to the icu with a ventricular
drain. there were no incidences of increased intracranial
pressure or decline. a cerebral perfusion study performed 
confirmed the lack of vasospasm and develoing strokes.

he had some r shoulder weakness and shoulder x-ray was
concerning for rotator cuff injury and orthopedics was
consulted.

on /14/15 his ventricular drain was clamped and reopened
due to elevated icp levels. on  he was transferred to the
sdu and continued to remain stable.  he had his ventricular
drain clamped on  and after 48 hours of the clamping trial
he had a ct done which was stable without any evidence of
hydrocephalus. at this time the drain was pulled.

he was placed on a fluid restriction for a brief period of time
for a drop in his na level, and also on salt tabs, upon
discharge to rehab we have removed the fluid restriction, but we
are continuing the salt tabs, we advise that the na level be
checked every other day, and the salt tabs may be d/c'ed when na
is stable on serial checks. upon discharge his na is 138.

he is now ready for discharge to rehab.

on discharge his exam is as follows:

alert and oriented x2
moving all extremities with full strength
slight right drift, which has been persistant throughout his
hospitalization, and possibly secondary to a rotator cuff
injury.

pertinent results:
ct head :
no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major cortical
territorial infarction.

cxr :
: new right lower lobe confluent opacity which may represent a
developing area of pneumonia. differential diagnosis includes
aspiration and
atelectasis. dedicated pa and lateral chest radiograph is
suggested for more
complete characterization when the patient's condition permits.

no contrast head ct 
 findings: there has been interval development of an area of
decreased attenuation at the left basal ganglia and
periventricular white matter in the distribution of the left
lenticulostriate artery consistent with a subacute infarct.
there is associated swelling with mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle. there is no shift of normally midline
structures. additional areas of hypodensity in the
periventricular white matter and right centrum semiovale are
unchanged and consistent with old infarctions. two calcified
meningiomas are again seen arising at the left frontal dura and
anterior olfactory groove. they are unchanged from prior study.
no intracranial hemorrhage was identified. surrounding osseous
and soft-tissue structures are unremarkable.

impression: subacute left lenticulostriate infarction which was
not present on head ct of 

echo :

the left atrium is normal in size. there is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity size is
normal. due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (lvef>55%). there is a
severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. right
ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the
aortic valve is not well  seen. there is probably mild aortic
valve stenosis. no aortic regurgitation is  seen. the mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral  regurgitation may be significantly underestimated.]
there is a significant  left ventricular inflow gradient which
may be due to mitral annular  calcification and mitral valve
calcification. the tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

leni :
no evidence of thrombus within the right upper extremity

brief hospital course:
patient was admitted with hypernatremia and acute mental status
changes and right sided paralysis. her corrected sodium on
admission was about 170s and her free water deficit was 5.5l.
she was volume repleted with normal saline. she also recieved
d51/4 ns for free water repletion initially and this was changed
to free water boluses through nasogastric tube. her sodium
gradually trended down with free water repletion. she also was
in pre-renal renal failure and her creatinine trended down with
hydration.

with regards to the acute mental changes, this is partially
explained by the hypernatrmic state. however, she was also noted
by the nursing home to have right sided weakness. ct head was
performed on admission which was negative for stoke. neurology
was consulted and found that she has a mca territory stroke by
exam. a repeat ct head was performed on  which showed
watershed infarct. tte which was also obtained did not reveal
any thrombus.per neurology recommendation, all her hypertensive
medication has been discontinued and she was started on aspirin.


chest xray on admission was concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia. her sputum culture grew mssa for which she was on
oxacillin. levofloxacin was also started for community acquired
pneumonia. nasal aspirate was sent for influenza and was
negative. she was intubated on  for increased respiratory
effort. her resporatory decompensation was likely from
aspiration pneumonia. she was extubated on  when her
lungs mechanic improved. however, given her  depressed mental
status and stroke, she was not able to clear her secretions
well. she was intubated again on  after unsuccessful attempt
to maintain her oxygen saturation with high flow mask. she
recieved tracheostomy and g tube and tolerated well post
procedure.

her  nutrition status was maintained by tubefeeds and insulin
sliding scale and nph kept her glucose within range.

her blood pressure was initially low on admission. this
responded well to hydration and brief use of levophed. her 
stimulation test was responsive. admission ekg showed st
depression in v2-v3 and it was unsure if this is old. she had
slightly elevated troponin, likely from acute renal failure
which eventually trending down.

plastic surgery was consulted for decubitus ulcer. no
debridement was indicated and their recommendation was to
maxmize nutrition, wet to dry dressing and tight glucose
control.

she remained on sc heparin, lansoprazole, pneumoboots and bowel
regimen as part of her porphylaxis. she had picc line placed
upon discharge

there had been multiple discussion with her daughter, which is
her health care proxy regarding code status. it was felt by the
medical team that her condition will not likely improve despite
optimal medical treatment. however, due to religious reasons,
her family remained steadfast that everything should be done.
however, her family agrees that should she go into cardiac
arrest, there should be no chest compression or defibrillation.

brief hospital course:
# pump/chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. 
with ef of 30-40% unchanged from prior. she currently appears
fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained
difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor
urine output.
- continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  were held
initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her
admission.
- hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial
of lasix proved successful.  she will now go home on 160 mg po
daily lasix and follow up with dr. , her nephrologist.
she will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition
consult during stay.
.
# cad: no evidence acs during hospitalization. patient is s/p
recent lcx stent.  she was continued on asa, carvedilol, plavix,
and losartan.

.
#. valves. no active issues. severe as a/p valvuloplasty
, stable as per . discussed with patient and family:
per their report, patient was previously evaluated by dr.
 in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve
replacment due to calcifications. patient may be candidate for
new cath-assisted valve replacement. also has mild mr on last
.  pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge.
.
# respiratory distress resolved -
respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial
secondary to volume overload and also pna as supported by
elevated wbc on presentation, fever, and now gnr in sputum gram
stain but not growing on culture. increased sputum overnight
while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents
resolving infection. received monotherapy with ceftazadime only
given gnr in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started
, continued for 7 days.  she will continue lasix as
outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema.
.
# anemia/gib:
hct drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if
represented true blood loss. ngt removed  and this
demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in ngt, likely
representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. ldh and
haptoglobin were checked with hct drop and were within normal
limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. she received 1 u
prbcs soon after admission, and hct has remained stable since.
her hcts were between 26 and 28.  stools were checked for guiac,
and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  we discharged her
home with protonix and recommend follow up with her pcp to
continue to monitor cbcs for watch for blood loss.  she is not
actively losing blood as seen by her stable hcts.  we also
recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  although, she needs to be
very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid
shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema.
.
# acute on chronic renal failure (stable cr):
acute on chronic renal failure likely due to atn secondary to
hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. patient had been
initiated on hd in ; was taken off hd ~1 week prior to
admission. volume overload/chf on admission, improved with uf,
now appears euvolemic. creatinine 1.... on discharge.  pt has
history of rcc with nephrectomy.  renal function has seemed to
normalize.  will continue follow up with nephrologist and he
will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter.

#  pt was discharge to home with services for pt and home health
care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

discharge instructions:
you were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your
lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  you
were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on
your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with
diuretics.  we also are continuing to give you the medicines
carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

you also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off
your lungs.

in addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission.
your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need
follow up with dr. .  you also have a dialysis catheter in
your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse.
dr.  will discuss removal of the catheter as an
outpatient.

we also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  you should
meet with your pcp and discuss having a colonoscopy.  make sure
to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the
bowel preparation they plan for you.

once at home, weigh yourself every morning, if weight >
3 lbs.
adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  call the nutritionist with any
questions.

also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest
pain, dizziness or fainting or any other worrisome symptoms, do
not hesitate to call your doctor or call 911 in case of
emergency.

heart failure, markedly improved since the prior study of
.  there was also bilateral lower lobe
opacification concerning for pneumonia.  ct angiogram
revealed consolidations at both lung bases consistent with
bibasilar pneumonia as well as subtle patchy opacifications
in the upper lobes with air fluid levels in the esophagus
suggesting possible aspiration.  there was no evidence of
pulmonary embolism.

cardiac studies:  ekg on admission revealed sinus rhythm with
mild left axis deviation.  there was also felt to be possible
left anterior fascicular block.  the admitting micu team
noted possible st elevations in v3 through v6.
echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal left ventricular cavity size.
overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.  there
was normal right ventricular systolic function.  there was
also moderate aortic regurgitation.  no pericardial effusion.

hospital course:
1.  respiratory distress:  on admission, the patient was felt
to have bilateral pneumonia, most likely secondary to
aspiration.  the patient was started on iv levaquin, flagyl
and vancomycin to cover for likely aspiration in a setting of
recent nursing home admission.  the patient was kept on
supplemental oxygen to keep oxygen saturations above 92% and
was kept npo on aspirations precautions.  on day of admission
antibiotics were changed to iv ceftazidine, flagyl and
vancomycin.  vancomycin was dosed at 1 gram q24 hours in the
setting of patient's decreased renal function, age and body
size.  on day two of admission the patient was also felt to
be fluid over loaded and gentle diuresis was resumed.  on day
two of admission the patient was felt to be stable for
transfer to the floor.  on the floor, the patient was
initially continued on iv antibiotics.  on day five of
admission the patient had a follow up chest x-ray which
revealed marked improvement in bibasilar pneumonia.  the
patient also had improvement in oxygen saturation and was
able to tolerate room air.  as a result, the patient was
transitioned to p.o. antibiotics and was given augmentin and
flagyl through the peg tube.  the patient was discharged home
on hospital day 9 with instructions to complete a 14 day
course of p.o. antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

2.  cardiovascular:  elevated troponin as well as possible st
elevations on admission were felt to reflect a demand
ischemia.  cardiac enzymes and ekg changes stabilized.  the
patient was continued on aspirin, lopressor throughout the
admission.  on day three of admission the patient had an
episode of sinus tachycardia likely secondary to dehydration
versus multi-focal atrial tachycardia secondary to pulmonary
disease.  this resolved following hydration.  the patient's
cardiovascular function remained stable for the rest of the
admission.

3.  dementia:  the patient was continued on aricept
throughout the admission.

4.  gastrointestinal:  following rehydration, the patient was
found to have a mildly decreased hematocrit.  as a result,
the patient was received an elevation by gastroenterology to
look for gastrointestinal bleeding as an etiology of
decreased hematocrit.  given the patient's history of peptic
ulcer disease, gastroenterology service recommended h. pylori
serology, which was negative.  iron studies were sent, which
revealed a decreased total iron binding capacity as well as
decreased iron suggestive of a combination of both blood loss
and chronic disease as etiologies of anemia.
gastroenterology service felt, however, that egd and
colonoscopy were not an option in setting of patient's recent
ischemic cardiac disease.  furthermore, the patient refused
gastroenterology work up.  gastroenterology service also
asked to evaluate patient for possible contribution of reflux
of jejunostomy tube feedings to development of aspiration
pneumonia.  gastroenterology service felt that reflux of
j-tube feedings was unlikely, however, felt that patient's
long history of esophageal dysmotility could be contributing
to aspiration.  they recommended swallowing study.  the
patient received an oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic
swallowing evaluation on day five of admission.  this
revealed mild oral with moderate to severe pharyngoesophageal
dysphagia with significant impaired upper esophageal
sphincter opening leading to severe residue of solids in the
pharynx.  however, there was no aspiration.  nevertheless,
swallowing service recommended the patient in future have
only thin liquids, pureed solids or very finely/minced meat
in p.o. diet.  they also recommended that the patient sit
bolt upright at meals and for 45 minutes after meals.  they
recommended the patient remain at 45 degrees in bed at all
times and should never lay flat in bed and recommended that
if patient must remain flat in bed that tube feedings be
discontinued for 30 minutes prior to patient laying flat in
bed.

5.  endocrine:  the patient was continued on levothyroxine
for hypothyroidism.

6.  gu:  the patient was placed on foley catheter on
admission to the hospital.  on day seven of admission the
patient was ready for discharge from a medical standpoint,
but did not void in time status post discontinuation of the
foley catheter.  as a result the patient remained in-house
for an additional day to ensure the patient could void
spontaneously following discontinuation of foley catheter.

post discharge medications:  metronidazole 500 mg q8 hours x7
days, augmentin 500/125 mg p.o. b.i.d. x7 days, furosemide 40
mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o.

p.o. q.d., multi-vitamin.

disposition:  to home with visiting nurse as well as 24 hour
home health assistance.

discharge status:  on day of discharge, the patient was
ambulating, voiding spontaneously and had oxygen saturation
of 97% on two liters.  the patient was demented in a manner
consistent with baseline.

history of present illness:  the patient is a 61 year old man
with a history of stage iii squamous lung carcinoma, status
post lobectomy and pneumonectomy on the right earlier this
year, who was transferred to  for respiratory failure.  two weeks prior to
admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of
shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea.  echocardiogram and
electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly
unremarkable.

on , after coming home from his son's wedding, the
patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and
collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe.
his family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the
field and taken to  hospital where a chest x-ray was
reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new
left bundle branch block, st elevations in leads ii through
v4 and q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which
was new.  he was transferred to the  and coronary care unit for further evaluation
and management.

past medical history:
1.  stage iii-a squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy, chemotherapy and radiation.

family history:  the patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39, and an older brother status post coronary
artery bypass graft.  his father also had coronary artery
disease and a sister has cardiac valve disease.

social history:  the patient quit smoking three months ago
following three to four packs per day times forty years.  he
consumed two to three drinks per day.  he is a construction
worker.

physical examination:  on admission, temperature is 99, heart
rate 70 to 80s, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95%.
in general, the patient was intubated and sedated.  head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination indicated the pupils
2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally.  endotracheal tube
is in place.  cardiovascular - tachycardia with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  pulmonary examination - the patient had
diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds
on the right.  the abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normal bowel sounds.  the extremities were warm with 1+
distal pulses.

laboratory data:  initial laboratory studies at the outside
hospital indicated that he had a white blood cell count of
11.4, hematocrit 41.0, platelets 466,000.  the differential
on the white blood cell count was 74% polys, 15% lymphocytes,
and 8% monocytes.  chem7 indicated a sodium of 136, potassium
5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 12,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 285.  prothrombin time was 22.4,
partial thromboplastin time 37.4, inr 3.0.  arterial blood
gases indicated a ph of 7.29, paco2 of 54, pao2 of 506 on a
100% fio2.  urinalysis was within normal limits.  cks were 41
and 57 with a troponin of 0.04 and then 0.6.

chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no
infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement.

hospital course:  the patient was admitted to the coronary
care unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction
with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat cks.  a transesophageal
echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and
apical hypokinesis.  the patient was also noted to develop
new onset rapid atrial fibrillation with associated
hypotension and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm but
remained hypotensive requiring pressors.  a ct angiogram was
performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.

on , a pa catheter was inserted which indicated
decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock.  the
patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101
while urine culture grew e. coli.  the patient was started on
intravenous levofloxacin, vancomycin and tobramycin and
transferred to the medical intensive care unit where he
received intravenous fluids and was changed from levophed to
vasopressin with good effect.  on , the pressors were
weaned.

bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture
sites with some thick secretions.  on , the patient
was successfully extubated.  over the weekend of ,
and , the patient defervesced with decreasing white
blood count and was successfully switched to oral medications
with stable blood pressure.  his antibiotics other than
levaquin were discontinued.  the patient was then transferred
to the c-medicine service for workup of coronary artery
disease.

cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary
artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex arteries with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.  the patient was
titrated up on a beta blocker ace inhibitor.  lipid panel
indicated a total cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 137,
ldl of 133 and hdl of 41.  he was therefore started on statin
therapy for hypercholesterolemia.

the patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the
30.0s during his stay in the c-medicine service and was found
to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, tibc of 228,
transferrin of 175. these findings were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease and thought secondary to his lung
cancer.

on the c-medicine service, the patient was noted to have
bilateral carotid bruits.  carotid doppler studies were
performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis
and mild plaquing bilaterally.

the patient was maintained on heparin during his hospital
course and started on coumadin two days prior to anticipated
discharge with plan to discharge to home on lovenox until the
patient reached a therapeutic inr of 2.0 to 3.0.

from an endocrine perspective, the patient was treated with
regular insulin sliding scale for his diabetes mellitus with
a plan to transition back to his home regimen of glyburide 5
mg p.o. q.d.  fingerstick blood sugar indicated good glycemic
control during hospital course.

a physical therapy consultation was arranged and at the time
of discharge dictation, it was anticipated that the patient
would be deemed safe for discharge to home with outpatient
physical therapy follow-up.

at the time of dictation, the patient was planned to be
discharged to home with vna.  he was also to follow-up in 
clinic for an inr check on the day following discharge and
was to follow-up with his primary care physician in  firm.
he was to complete a fourteen day course of levaquin, which
had been switched to p.o. on the day prior to his discharge
in order to treat his urinary tract infection.

discharge diagnoses:
1.  urosepsis.
2.  acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac
catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery
stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex.

history of present illness:  the patient is a 62 year-old
male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer
treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with
saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart
failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently
admitted from  to  for presumed
bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough,
shortness of breath and fevers.  during his last admission
two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day
prednisone taper and augmentin for one week.  he underwent
bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial
lesion, which was normal.  sputum sample was done at that
time showed no growth.  he was discharged at his baseline
function on .  the plan was to treat him for one
week of augmentin, skip one week followed by bactrim for one
week, skip one week and then on augmentin for two weeks for
pneumonia prophylaxis.  the last dose of augmentin was
 after being on augmentin for only three days.

he was doing well until approximately one week ago when he
developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was
due to low potassium.  within the following days he
complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum.  he
had a low grade temperature, mild headache and worsening
cough and presented to the emergency department.  he denied
any sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dysuria or joint pain.  in the emergency department
he was febrile to 102 orally and had a heart rate of 160 and
a blood pressure of 118/56.  respiratory rate 28.  sating 88
to 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  initially he was stable, but
then had a gradual change in mental status with hypoxia,
which resulted in his elective intubation.  he received lasix
100 mg intravenous twice, 1 mg of bumex and 1 gram of
ceftriaxone as well as 125 mg of solu-medrol.  he was also
placed on a heparin drip for a subtherapeutic inr and given
morphine and ativan for sedation.  chest x-ray showed no
focal pneumonia or evidence of heart failure.  the patient
then underwent a ct angiogram of the chest that showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.

social history:  the patient quit smoking in 
following a forty year history of smoking three to four packs
a day.  he consumed two to three drinks alcoholic drinks per
day and was a construction worker.

family history:  the patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39 and an older brother who had a coronary
artery bypass graft.  his father also had coronary artery
disease and he had a sister with cardiac valvular disease.

physical examination:  this was a gentleman who was
intubated, sedated and responsive only to noxious stimuli.
pupils were unremarkable.  there were no bruits in the neck.
heart had a regular rate and rhythm with normal s1 and s2
sounds, faint heart sounds overall.  occasional ectopic
beats. lungs were clear to auscultation on the left with
transmitted breath sounds on the right.  abdomen was soft and
mildly distended with decreased bowel sounds.  extremities
showed no evidence of ulcers, trace edema in both lower
extremities and no cyanosis or clubbing.  skin showed no
evidence of rashes.

laboratory examination:  urinalysis was unremarkable.  white
blood cell count 23, hematocrit 42, platelets were 297.

hospital course:  upon admission to the hospital the patient
was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where he
was treated for presumed bronchitis versus tracheobronchitis
versus atypical pneumonia.  blood sputum, urine and stool
cultures were sent and ceftriaxone and azithromycin were
started.

1.  infectious disease:  the patient did not develop a focal
infiltration throughout his hospitalization.  his ceftriaxone
was stopped and he was continued on azithromycin.  he
remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay
and his white blood cell count decreased daily.  on hospital
day two he was stable for extubation and tolerated extubation
very well.  he was then transferred on hospital day number
three out of the intensive care unit to the medical floor.
he continued to improve clinically with a decrease in his
fever curve and decrease in his oxygen requirements.  he also
subjectively improved and on his last hospital day he was
comfortable and ambulating without oxygen.  he stated that he
had come back to his baseline.  white blood cell count
returned to  range, and cultures were negative except
for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive
coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge.

2.  pulmonary:  this was treated as possible
tracheobronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease versus atypical pneumonia.  the patient was kept on
his usual inhaler and nebulizing medications as well as
azithromycin and intravenous solu-medrol.  after hospital day
number two and the patient was extubated and improving the
solu-medrol was switched to prednisone and was rapidly
tapered.  the patient was encouraged to ambulate and was
given regular respiratory treatment and chest physical
therapy.  by the end of the hospitalization the patient felt
that he had returned to his baseline lung function, baseline
pulmonary function and was coughing up less dark sputum.  to
manage his congestive heart failure lasix was used
judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of
the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily
weights.  the patient responded to this well and felt overall
that his symptoms of volume overload had improved.

3.  cardiovascular:  based on his presentation, it was not
clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his
change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent.  three
sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.  he had a number of electrocardiograms
that were checked to ensure that he did not have a
significantly prolonged qtc interval and that it was not
worse.

4.  endocrine:  the patient was followed with blood glucose
measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor
control with the glyburide and the regular insulin sliding
scale.  as the regular insulin sliding scale was increased
and the prednisone was tapered these values returned closer
to normal.

condition on discharge:  improved.

discharge status:  to home.

the patient had been using care group respiratory services at
home for pulmonary physical therapy and o2 assistance and so
this was arranged on an outpatient basis, with chest physical
therapy and incentive spirometry and other pulmonary
treatments.  the plan was that he would follow up with dr.
 in clinic the following week and that he would have
an inr drawn on  calling the results to dr. .

chief complaint:  respiratory distress.

history of present illness:  the patient is a 62-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for lung cancer
status post right pneumonectomy in , six
hospitalizations since , last discharged on
, with the diagnosis of tracheal bronchitis
versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, versus
atypical pneumonia, status post intubation in the micu,
chronic secretions/congestion-related problems, on
alternating regimen of augmentin and bactrim since  for multiple bronchitic-like infections, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure,
atrial fibrillation, prior pes, diabetes type 2, status post
myocardial infarction, who presented with gradual shortness
of breath beginning on the day of admission.

the patient reported a  day history of general fatigue.
on the day of admission, visiting nurse services reported a
systolic blood pressure of 70.  the wife drove the patient to
the emergency room.  the patient also complained of some
dizziness, however denied other symptoms including fever,
chills, sweats, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea,
vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  he reported good p.o. intake
and appetite.

the patient reported that he has a chronic, slight cough,
however, denied any sputum production.  he took his oral
temperature at home and denied any fever.  at home, the
patient is on oxygen of  l via nasal cannula.  the patient
recently finished a steroid taper on  which was
two weeks in length.  he reported a usual sbp of 80-110.  the
patient did note that since , a scopolamine patch was
added to his regimen and has increased his secretions
significantly.

emergency department course:  per emergency room, the patient
appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed
on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an abg of 7.46, pco2
of 48, and po2 of 33.  there was a question if this was a
venous gas or not.  lasix 100 mg iv, albuterol nebs,
solu-medrol 600 mg iv, and ceftriaxone 1 g iv was given to
the patient.  when evaluated by the micu shortly after

in .  he smoked 3-4 packs per day for 40 years.  no
alcohol abuse.  he is a retired construction worker.

family history:  sister died at age 39 of cancer.  brother is
status post coronary artery bypass grafting.  father with
history of coronary artery disease.  sister with heart valve
disease.

physical examination:  vital signs:  temperature 98.5??????, heart
rate 70, blood pressure 89-122/60-77, respirations 19-20,
oxygen saturation 100% on 2 l nasal cannula.  general:  the
patient was in no apparent respiratory distress.  he was
comfortable.  he was alert and awake.  heent:  pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  extraocular
movements intact.  normocephalic, atraumatic.  moist mucous
membranes.  oropharynx clear.  cardiovascular:  regular, rate

laboratory data:  white count 10.4, hematocrit 30.0, which is
baseline, platelet count 388; chem7 was unremarkable; pt
22.5, ptt 31.3, inr 3.5; b12 327, folate 12.7.

electrocardiogram unchanged from prior.  theophylline level
4.3.

chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung
with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no
pneumothorax, no effusion.  ct angiogram showed no acute pe,
possible chronic pe in pulmonary artery segment in the left
lower lobe that is not occlusive.

hospital course:  this was a 62-year-old male with a past
medical history of lung carcinoma status post right
pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since 
for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating
antibiotic regimen of augmentin and bactrim, recent
hospitalization in micu with intubation, chronic secretions,
and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure,
prior pes, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with
respiratory distress.

1.  respiratory distress:  the patient was given lasix,
albuterol nebs, and solu-medrol in the emergency department
and had rapid improvement of his symptoms.  it was thought
that the patient's acute respiratory distress was most likely
secondary to mucous plugging.  pe was ruled out by cta.
chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure
or pneumonia.  the patient also recently completed a steroid
taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this
admission.  he had no cough and no sputum production and no
fevers.  the patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids, as
it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was
unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress
and because it was unclear whether steroids was really
benefitting this patient.

he continued to have aggressive chest physical therapy for
secretion management and was continued on his scopolamine
patch, serevent, combivent, atrovent/albuterol nebs, and
inhalers.  he was also continued on his alternating
prophylactic antibiotic regimen of augmentin and bactrim.  he
continued to do well and recorded oxygen saturations of
greater than 92%.  on the day of discharge, oxygen saturation
was 97% on room air.

of note, the patient was observed in the micu overnight but
was discharged to the floor quickly and had no other episodes
of respiratory distress.

2.  hypotension:  the visiting nurse noted a systolic blood
pressure of 70; however, by the time the patient came to the
emergency room, he had an sbp of 90.  it was thought that the
patient's slightly decreased sbp was secondary to
hypovolemia.  he was given gentle fluid hydration.  he also
had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal
insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid
taper; however, this was done after solu-medrol had been
given to the patient.  it was reportedly negative, but it was
unclear as to how accurate this is in the setting of recent
solu-medrol dosing.  his lasix was decreased from 160 mg
b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d., and his ace inhibitor was
discontinued.  he continued to remain normovolemic during the
rest of his hospitalization.

3.  cardiovascular:  in terms of the patient's history of
perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and
congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his
amiodarone and lasix 80 mg b.i.d.   he also continued aspirin
and lipitor.  his electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was
thought that there was not any significant cardiac component
to the patient's respiratory distress.

4.  endocrine:  the patient was continued on his glyburide
and was covered with an insulin sliding scale in the
hospital.

5.  history of pulmonary embolus:  the patient was continued
on his coumadin while in-house.  no further work-up was done.

6.  code status:  the patient is full code.

disposition:  he will be discharged to pulmonary
rehabilitation to try to maximize his pulmonary status.  he
appears to be doing very well with physical therapy during
this hospitalization and has slightly improved his exercise
tolerance.  he will also be started on a morphine elixir 5-10
mg sublingually p.r.n. q.6 hours for shortness of breath to
relieve the patient's symptom of air hunger.

discharge diagnosis:
1.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  mucous plugging.
3.  congestive heart failure.
4.  hypotension.
5.  diabetes type 2.
6.  history of pulmonary embolus on coumadin therapy.

history of present illness:  the patient is a 63 year old
male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, lung cancer, status post right
pneumonectomy in , complicated by pulmonary artery
laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for
oxygen and suctioning who was in his usual state of health
until  when he developed nausea, lower
abdominal pain, and projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.
he presented to the 
emergency room on .  at that time he denied
diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, hematochezia and
bright red blood per rectum.  he had dark stools at baseline
secondary to iron use.  the stool was found to be guaiac
positive in the emergency department.  in the emergency
department also his hematocrit value was 19, down from a
baseline of 31 one month previously and he was coagulopathic
with an inr of 9.8.  attempts to place a nasogastric tube in
the emergency department were unsuccessful.  while in the
emergency department, he was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg of
subcutaneous vitamin k.  the patient was admitted to the
medicine floor.  repeat hematocrit several hours later
dropped to a value of 13.  the nasogastric tube was placed on
the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood.
he was, at that point, transferred to the medical intensive
care unit.  workup while in the medical intensive care unit
included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh
blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7
cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately
25 cm.  there was no evidence of stigmata of recent bleeding.
he was stabilized with a total of seven units of packed red
blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit
of platelets.  he also received intravenous fluid
resuscitation with normal saline.  computerized tomography
scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for
diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed.
colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed
some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and
descending colon.  internal hemorrhoids were noted but no
stigmata of recent bleeding.  the patient's coagulopathy was
improving.  his hematocrit was stable, and he was transferred
to the general medicine floor on .  of note,
prior to transfer he developed swelling of the right upper
extremity and complained of pain of the right upper
extremity.  doppler ultrasound was performed which showed
evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis.

clear.  there was no free air in the abdomen.  there was a
large amount of fecal material in the right colon.  there was
a normal bowel gas pattern.  there was no evidence of
obstruction.  later computerized tomography scan of the
abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no intra-abdominal abscess,
bowel inflammation, evidence of perforated ulcer,
appendicitis or diverticulitis.  electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats/minute, normal axis,
prolonged qt interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, t
wave inversions were noted in leads v1 and v2 which were new.
no acute st elevations or depressions noted.  this was
compared with the prior electrocardiogram from .

hospital course:  in summary, this is a 63 year old male with
past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in
 complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration,
status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and
suctioning.  he was in his usual state of health until
 when he developed nausea, lower abdominal
pain, projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.  his
hematocrit dropped from 31 to a nadir of 13.  his
gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the medical
intensive care unit.

1.  anemia secondary to acute blood loss - the patient's
gastrointestinal workup included two
esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one
without source of frank bleed.  however, in light of his
initial complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, and guaiac
positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected.
physically the small bowel could be the source.  after
stabilization in the medical intensive care unit with blood
products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was
transferred to the medicine floor after having stable
hematocrit for greater than 24 hours.  while on the floor,
his hematocrit was checked initially every 12 hours.  after
demonstrating stability for a total of 72 hours it was spaced
out to q. day hematocrit checks.  all told the patient
received 7 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh
frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital
stay.  on , the patient underwent repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples
of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study.  at
the time of this dictation results of those biopsies were
pending.  while in the medical intensive care unit the
patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether
hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia.  he had a
normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and
bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very
unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19.
moreover, no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear.
hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his
hospital course and were consistent with changes status post
large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing
hemolysis.

2.  right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - on  the patient began to complain of right upper
extremity pain and swelling.  doppler ultrasound demonstrated
an axillary deep vein thrombosis.  in light of his recent
bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially.
although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize
as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was
still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of
the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the
functionality of his one remaining lung.  the computerized
tomography scan was performed to better examine the right
upper extremity soft tissues.  in particular there was
concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass
lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be
contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep
vein thrombosis formation.  computerized tomographic venogram
was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis,
however.  the patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced
by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in
the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there
was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses.  therefore,
an inferior vena cava filter was placed on .
the patient tolerated the procedure well.  on , the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling
of the right lower extremity.  examination was consistent
with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity.
however, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava
filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the
decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging
of the right lower extremity.  in light of his probable
hypercoagulability, decision was made to reinitiate
anticoagulation with the coumadin.  his coumadin level will
be followed by his outpatient physician, .  .
his inr should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation
facility and his coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a
goal inr of 2 to 3.

3.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma
status post right pneumonectomy - the patient was continued
on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary
toilet.  he was continued on his outpatient medicines,
combivent, salmeterol, and theophylline.  he was continued on
antibiotic prophylaxis with bactrim double strength in light
of his history of bronchiectasis.  he was monitored for acute
decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly
concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper
extremity deep vein thrombosis.  he continued to improve from
a respiratory standpoint.  he was diuresed gently after
arriving to the medicine floor status post fluid
resuscitation and blood product administration in the medical
intensive care unit in the setting of his acute bleed.  with
the diuresis, pulmonary toilet and supportive care, his
respiratory status improved somewhat.  however, he is not
back to his baseline of 2 liters of oxygen nasal cannula at
home.  at the time of discharge he was maintaining
saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he
continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and
shortness of breath, occasionally at rest.  it was felt that
a lot the patient's dyspnea was secondary to muscle
deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital
stay.  therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary
rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his
conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status.

4.  diabetes mellitus 2 - the patient was maintained on a
diabetic diet, with q.i.d. fingersticks, fingerstick blood
glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding
scale.  he was maintained on his outpatient dose of neurontin
for neuropathy.

5.  atrial fibrillation - he was continued on his outpatient
dose of amiodarone.  of note, he is currently in sinus
rhythm.

6.  acute renal failure - the patient on admission had an
elevated creatinine level above his baseline.  this was
likely secondary to prerenal causes, specifically hypovolemia
and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his
acute bleeding episode.  his acute renal failure resolved
after fluid hydration.

7.  vitamin b12 deficiency - the patient was continued on his
outpatient regimen of supplementation with vitamin b12, 1000
mcg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  hypercholesterolemia - the patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

9.  depression/anxiety - the patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of paroxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d.

10.  fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - the patient was fed
a diabetic heart-healthy diet.  he received supplementation
with multivitamins and vitamin b12.  electrolytes were
aggressively repleted.  at the time of discharge he was
tolerating regular diet without nausea, vomiting or other
incident.

disposition:  with the patient's general deconditioning as
well as his pulmonary status being slightly below his
baseline i felt that he would benefit from an inpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation program.  he will be discharged to
such a program.

discharge condition:  hemodynamically stable.  afebrile.
oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula,
ambulating independently, tolerating  intake without
nausea or vomiting.

discharge status:  the patient is discharged to an extended
care facility.

discharge diagnosis:
1.  anemia due to acute blood loss, likely secondary to
gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
3.  lung carcinoma, status post right pneumonectomy
4.  history of perioperative pulmonary embolism

history of present illness:  this is a 63-year-old male with
history of multiple medical problems who was recently
admitted to the  from
 to  with projectile vomiting and
hematocrit of 13.

he had negative hemolysis workup and negative egd times two
and a colonoscopy times one.  found to have a right upper and
right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.   
filter was placed, and he was transferred to  rehab
and went home in late 01/.

he received seven units of packed red blood cells, seven
units of fresh frozen plasma, and one unit during previous
hospitalization and two units of packed red blood cells while
he was at .  he had no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, bright red blood per rectum.

ten days ago his coumadin and aspirin were continued for
planned egd and colonoscopy with good prep.  on  he
had an egd polyp removed from the esophagus which was
negative.  his colonoscopy revealed two polyps which were
adenomatous without any complications.

physical examination on admission:  vitals:  temperature
98.4, pulse 94, blood pressure 100/65, respiratory rate 18,
sat 96% on room air.  in general, he is well developed, well
nourished male; awake, alert, and oriented times three; in no

reactive.  extraocular muscles are intact.  oropharynx is
slightly dry; no lesions.  neck is supple; no

chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, bun 20, creatinine 1.0, glucose
149, ck 96, troponin 0.06.

ekg with sinus rhythm at 94 with normal axis; poor baseline;
no other st-t wave changes.

hospital course:  this is a 63-year-old man with multiple
medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia
and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple
polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on
 and represented with lower abdominal pain and
bright red blood per rectum and anemia.

1.  gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia:  most
likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and
polypectomy.  patient had a negative egd and then had a
colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of
previous polypectomy.  this was clipped with two clips with
good control of the bleeding.

patient's hematocrit remained stable.  he did receive a total
of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission.
after colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright
red blood per rectum was noted.  patient's hematocrits were
followed serially and remained in the 26, 27 range and
eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to
discharge, but his hematocrit remained 29 and 31 on day of
discharge.

otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced
his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he
tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright
red blood per rectum.

patient was initially started on protonix 40 intravenously
b.i.d. as his egd was negative.  eventually was switched back
to his 40 p.o. q. day regimen which he continued even as an
outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease.

patient's blood pressure remained stable after transfused
with blood.  he also had a negative tagged red cell scan and
negative egd.  eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small
bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as
in his previous admission.  this was also negative.  patient
could not have a meckel scan during this stay because of
barium and can have it at least one week after barium
ingestion.

because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed, patient's
lovenox dose and coumadin dose were continued to be held.
patient's anticoagulation, including aspirin, coumadin, and
lovenox, were to be held for at least one week and can be
restarted on  per gi.

2.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  patient's
respiratory status was stable and at baseline.  continued his
home regimen of advair, combivent, and theophylline and
p.r.n. nebulizers as needed, although his pulmonary exam
remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of 2
liters and will be discharged on the same regimen.

3.  status post lung cancer, status post pneumonectomy:  was
stable with tracheostomy.  continued b.i.d. suctioning with
good results.  continue the scopolamine patch for
antiemetics.

4.  prostate cancer:  he does have recently rising psa most
recently 8.9 in 02/.  patient was eventually able to have
a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative
for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony
changes.  patient will be followed up with urologist, dr.
, in terms of his prostate cancer follow up.

5.  troponin leak:  this was attributed to demand ischemia.
he had negative ekg changes, and he had a catheterization in
 which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting
disease.  his enzymes remained stable through the course of
his stay and was attributed to his anemia.  patient's aspirin
was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted
.  patient was continued on his statin.

6.  atrial fibrillation:  patient was in sinus rhythm
throughout the course of his stay and was stable on
amiodarone.  again, his coumadin was held for concerns with
bleeding.

7.  deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus:  he has a
history of  filter and right upper and right lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis.  his hypercoagulable state
is likely attributed to the prostate cancer, but otherwise
his coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons, and patient
did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper
and right lower extremity.

patient was taken off his lasix dose through the course of
the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability.  was
given p.r.n. doses of lasix throughout the stay and continued
to elevate his extremities with good results of them.

patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds
done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis.  the right lower
extremity ultrasound was negative.  the right upper extremity
did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but
no progression or change from previous studies, and this
otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay.

8.  diabetes:  he has fairly good control with hemoglobin a1c
most recently at 6.0.  he was continued on his home regimen
of glyburide once he was taking p.o. and covered with sliding
scale as needed.

for his neuropathy patient was continued on his tylenol
number 3 and was discharged with a prescription for morphine
sulfate per his request, although he was not continued on
this during the course of his stay.

9.  gout:  this was stable throughout the course of his
admission, but patient was continued on his home dose of
colchicine.

discharge diagnoses:
1.  lower gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  blood loss anemia.
3.  history of deep venous thrombosis.

status, with desaturation and tachypnea, along with agitation
and confusion. ph with pco2 in 90s. placed on cpap,
unsuccessfully. repeat abg with paco2 87, ph 7.29. patient
intubated. arterial line finally placed successfully. extubated
on  but extremely anxious and hypertensive and hypercarbic.
placed on bipap and reintubated.  trach placed.  pt was

brief hospital course:
64 year-old male with history of lung cancer post-right
pneumonectomy, severe copd, recent trach and  placement and
antibiotic course for pneumonia, now returns from  rehab
with diarrhea, stage iv sacral decubitus ulcer, and sepsis. no
source of infection had been identified so far. he was c-diff
negative, blood/urine/sputum culture had not yield any organism.
he was treated empirically with ceftazidime, vancomycin and
metronidazole for 7 days. his blood pressure responded to fluid
challenge and he has been normotensive since then. he was
started on stress dose steroid which was weaned off. he was
gradually weaned off ventilation and tolerated trach mask well.

his blood sugar was well controlled with glargine and sliding
scale. he was also noted to have decubitus ulcer. plastic
surgery was consulted and felt that debridement was not
necessary. therefore, he was cotinued on wet to dry dressing,
kinair bed and his nutrition was optimized. he remiained in
normal sinus rhythm and is on coumadin for history of atrial
fibrillation.

he was very agitated in the icu. he was weaned off fentanyl drip
and put on fentanyl patch. he also was put on standing zyprexa
and prn haldol, morphine. he was also on standing valium and was
actually thought to be in benzo withdrawal as his wife claims
that he was on valium at home.he is full code and his health
care proxy is his wife.

brief hospital course:
a/p: 64 yo man s/p lung ca s/p pneumonectomy and severe copd
here after prolonged admission for respiratory failure requiring
tracheostomy placement here with new left sided chest pain.
.
1. chest pain: multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were cycled and
ck/mb remained flat while troponin increased slightly and then
remained stable at 0.12.  repeat ekgs showed no changes.
cardiology was consulted and agreed that there was no evidence
of an acute ischemic event.  pt was continued on asa.  the pt's
chest pain may be related to his chronic svc syndrome.
.
2. respiratory failure: pt on a prolonged ventilator wean
secondary to copd, pneumonectomy, lung cancer and hx of
recurrent pneumonias.  pt was continued on ac at night and
pressure support during the day.  he will continued to wean at
rehab.
.
3. bilateral upper extremety swelling: this has been chronic
since last admission w/o evidence of dvt.  pt had another cta in
the er that showed no pe but did show a narrowing of the svc.
interventional radiology placed a stent in the svc and over the
next several days, the pt's upper ext swelling improved.
.
4. atrial fibrillation: pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for
most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib
with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own.  pt was
continued on his coumadin.
.
5. anxiety: pt has a long history of anxiety controlled on
fentanyl, morphine prn, haldol. avoid benzos as pt has
paradoxical response.
*
6. anemia: likely secondary to chronic disease- baseline around
28.  iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal
tibc, ferritin.  he was transfused once to  hct>30.
.
7. dm type 2: pt's glucose was controlled with glargine and an
insulin sliding scale.
.
8. access: a picc line was placed by ir when pt was having his
svc stented.  if this line is not needed, it should be pulled to
decrease infection risk.  it was placed on .

brief hospital course:
65yo man with many medical problems p/w hypotension in the
setting of rapid aitral flutter. also with a urinary tract
infection.

assessment/plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p
right pneumonectomy, severe copd, recent trach and  
rehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and uti.
.
1. hypotension:   have been due to infection from uti vs.
symptomatic tachycardia.
responded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control.
remained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. of note,
his blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported
that this is a  problem for him.
.
2. atrial flutter: he has a known history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.his was initially in rapid atrial fluuter with 2:1
conduction. this initially responded to diltiazem. on hopital
day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with
electrophysiology service amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem
was stopped (as he had been on amiodarone for 3.5 years in the
past, and it had to be discontinued  due to bradycardia
when lopressor was added).  he remained in sinus rhythm for the
remainder of the hospitalization. plan is continue amiodarone
400mg tid x 1 week then 400mg  x 1 week then 200mg po qd
thereafter.  he is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel
blockers.

3. respiratory failure:  his chest x-ray showed no evidence of
pneumonia. due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by
respiraotory. an interventional pulmonolgy consult was obtained
due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.  dr.
 recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff
leak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to
change the trach to a foam-filled trach ( tube) in the
future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to
ventilate.  he was continued on ps as tolerated with periods of
rest on assist control.
.
4. klebsiella urinary tract infection: he was initally started
on ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given
history of heart block to levo, he was changed to bactrim to
complete a 7-day course for complicated uti. the urine culture
grew klebsiella which is sensitive to bactrim.his foley catheter
was discontinued.
.
5.acute blood loss anemia: his baseline hematocrit was 28-30. he
was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3,
his hematorcit dropped to 19.  due to extensive bleeding from
site of central line, he was transfused 2 uprbc and had an
appropriate bump in his hematocrit. he was noted to have 
guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive
bleeding from internal jugular catheter site into his
trach/mouth. his hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient,
and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for
trace blood.
.
6. bleeding from central line site. he is maintained on coumadin
for atrial fibrillation and his inital inr was therapeutic.
after ij placement, he had continued oozing from ij site leading
to anemia with hct 19.   he was given ffp and vitamin k (0.5 mg
iv) to reverse his coagultopathy. he should be restarted on
coumadin for atrial fibrillation at rehab.
.
5. diabetes mellitis: he was continued on glargine and regular
insulin sliding scale. his sugars were in good control.
.
6. pain/anxiety/depression:
he was continued on his outpatient doses of fentanyl
75mcg/q72hours, haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg
tid/prn, and paxil.   his pain is from his scaral decubitus
ulcer.
.
7. sacral decubitus: he was seen by wound care nurse and
continued on dsd for sacral wound.
.
8. left upper extremity swelling: he had u/s which showed...
.
9. diastolic congestive heart failure: he was given lasix prn to
keep fluid even.
.
10.code: full
.
11. dispo: discharged to  rehab.
.
12. access: the right internal jugular vein triple lumen
catheter was not discontinued per  request. this was
placed on .
------
outstanding issues on discharge:
1.the pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of
discharge .  please monitor his inr and adjust dose
accordingly.
2.the pt has a swollen l arm and had u/s on day of discharge to
r/o clot. no read has been given yet. please call  to
follow this up. regardless, he is being restarted on
anticoagulation which would be treatment of choice.

history of present illness:
65 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problem including
history of lung cancer post right pneumonectomy in , severe
copd, post tracheostomy and  placement(respiratory failure
due to pneumonia) recently admitted to  for urosepsis, now
presenting yet again with hypotension and altered mental status.

patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from
records. pt was admitted to  on  after an admission
at  for a klebsiella uti and hypotension. since his
admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to
the commode with assistance. on , the pt became lethargic
and then gradually unresponsive. on , his bp decreased to
60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. he received
a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his bp to 90/40. he remained
unresponsive during this time. abg showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an
fio2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. of note, pt's triple
lumen was placed .

maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend.
yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked very scared
and would often stare at the ceiling. he also had periods of his
eyes rolling back in his head. he was occasionally responsive
to her. she reports that they had been checking abgs over the
last 24 hours and his co2 had been elevated. when they changed
the vent settings to decrease the co2, she felt that he was
slightly less confused. she also notes that he was very
diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen.
the pt's bp has always been very low in his left arm and she
reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to
a skin tear on the right.

changes but no major changes since previous studies.
.
cxr- stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. right
lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal
contours toward the right consistent with previous
pneumonectomy. there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural
effusion. slightly increased interstitial markings int he left
lung which appear stable. no new left pneumo or focal
consolidation.
.
head ct (wet read)- no hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or
evidence of hydrocephalus. no evidence of a major cva.

us upper extremity:impression:
1) nonocclusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein.
2) nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins

transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. the
gallbladder is not distended. there is an 8-9 mm stone located
at the neck of the gallbladder. the gallbladder wall is
thickened. there are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps
located at the fundus of the gallbladder. no intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. the common
duct is not dilated and measures 3 mm. flow in the portal vein
is anterograde. limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no
focal abnormality.

impression: thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the
gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder. in the proper
clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with
cholecystitis. they are not completely typical for acute
cholecystitis. gallbladder wall thickening may also be produced
by third spacing of fluids. if there is continued clinical
concern for cholecystitis, a hida scan may be performed for
further evaluation.

technique: ct images of the chest without the administration of
iv contrast.

comparison:  and .

findings:
soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right
pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right. there is
no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
there is a left pleural effusion. the patient is intubated with
a tracheostomy tube. a stent is again identified within the
right brachiocephalic vein. the heart demonstrates coronary
calcifications, but is normal in size. the main pulmonary artery
appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm.

lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen
scattered throughout the left lung. no specific areas of
cavitation are identified within these nodules. atelectasis is
also seen at the left lung base. there is no focal consolidation
or pneumothorax. septal thickening is seen throughout the left
lung field. a small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is
again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the
surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities. however, on
the study from , this nodule was clearly seen and appears
stable dating back to . the bronchi appear patent to the
segmental level within the left lung.

images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material
within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating
to sludge. a percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen within the
stomach. the remainder of the visualized portion of the upper
abdomen is unremarkable other than arterial calcifications. the
soft tissues are unremarkable. degenerative changes are seen
throughout the thoracic spine.

impression:
1) multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the
entire left lung. these most likely represent aspiration
pneumonia. septic emboli are considered less likely based on the
ct appearance.
2) mild chf.
3) left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of 
demonstrates stability dating back to .
4) probable sludge within the gallbladder.
5) findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension.


brief hospital course:
65 y/o man with pmh significant for squamous cell lung ca, type
2 dm, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from
 with mental status change and hypotension.

#id/sepsis
patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating
blood pressure, lactate 1.3. his blood pressure in the ed was
measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower). his
blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors
were off. sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas),
blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on
discharge. his decubitus ulcer looks clean. his line was resited
line to the right femoral. chest ct was consistent with
aspiration pneumonia. he will be continued on zosyn for 14 days.
he remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the
rest of his hospital stay.

#mental status changes:
his mental status improved with decreasing co2 and also with
narcan. his co2 remained well controlled in the hospital and was
at baseline in 70s. ct head was negative. narcotics was taken
into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes.
patient's duragesic patch was removed in the ed.

#anemia/coagulation
patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with ivc filter
and svc clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on
coumadin. coumadin was taken off 3 days prior to hospital
admission because he had blood oozing from his trach and foley.
in hospital, central line was attempted intially on the right
subclavian but the artery was puctured. his right femoral artery
was also punctured and he did lose a signifcant amount of blood.
the 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no
hematoma. he also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which
revealed dvt in left arm for which he was started on heparin
drip. he then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from
arterial line site. heparin drip was then stopped and he was
given 2 unit of transfusion. his hematocrit had been stable
since then. on discharge, coumadin was not restarted. it should
be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable.
.
#transaminitis
he presented intially with transaminitis likely from
hypotension. lfts trended down on discharge. ruq ultrasound was
done which showed gallstone at neck of gb, no distension,
thickened gallbladder. he remained afebrile and has no abdominal
tenderness

#respiratory:
patient has squamous cell lung ca post right pneumonectomy and
post tracheostomy. during his past admission there was concern
about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. dr. 
recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to
prevent further tracheamalacia. possible change the trach to a
foam-filled trach ( tube) in the future if the cuff leak
is interfering with the ability to ventilate. he remained on
assist control ventilation.
.
#  pt with mildly elevated na at 148. this is most
likely due to water deficit as he can not drink to replace his
needs. he recieved free water through g tube.
.
# cardiac
patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such
complain during this hospitalization. cardiac enzymes were
unremarkable. he was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone
for atrial fibrillation. he is to avoid beta blockers and
calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia.
.
#type 2 diabetes mellitus
patient was continued on standing 8u glargine and sliding scale
while in hospital.

#anxiety/pain
patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at
baseline. he was continues on his outpatient doses of haldol for
anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. his pain is
from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain. anxiety has been
severely worsened in the past with ativan. would avoid further
ativan. fentanyl patch was discontinued since there was a
concern regarding narcotic overdose. he was on prn morphine.
this should be adjusted in .

# sacral decubitus:
he had kinair bed

# fen
tube feeds was continued with no residual

#access
he had picc line on discharge

#code
ok with pressor, do not resuscitate(confirmed again with family
meeting)

 upper gi : in this patient status post gastric bypass and
partial gastrectomy with repair
of marginal ulcer, there is free flow of contrast through the
gastric pouch and the gastrojejunostomy. no leak or holdup of
contrast identified in this study.


brief hospital course:
mr.  was admitted to the hospital and examined by the
bariatric service. he had no abdominal pain but had dilaudid
prior to his transfer.  his cardiac work up was negative and due
to the finding of pneumoperitoneum on abd ct he was taken to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. he had a
perforated marginal ulcer and underwent a partial gastrectomy,
omental patch to ulcer and a cholecystectomy. he tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the icu in stable condition.
his pain was controlled with a dilaudid pca and he remained
hemodynamically stable.
he was subsequently transferred to the surgical floor for
further management.

due to his recent surgery and length of time prior to taking
fluids he had a picc line placed for tpn which began on 
through a right ac picc line.  this was continued until .
in the interim he had an upper gi on  which showed no
anastomotic leak and he gradually began a stage 1 diet.  this
was slowly advanced over the next 24 hours to stage 3 and he had
no trouble with nausea or fullness.

his abdominal wound was healing well and he was up and walking
independently.  he remained free of any pulmonary complications
post op by using his incentive spirometer.  roxicet was
effective in treating his incisional pain and he was generally
improving every day.

after an uncomplicated course he was discharged to home on
 and will follow up with dr.  in 2 weeks.

chief complaint:  fevers.

history of present illness:  the patient is an 84-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for parkinson
disease with associated  body dementia and a long history
of tobacco abuse who was noted with fevers.

the patient was in her usual state of health until two weeks
prior to admission when she developed rhinorrhea.  the
patient and her daughter deny any other symptoms at that
time.

however, on the evening of  the patient
reports that she developed pain in the right side of her
neck.  the following day, she had a temperature to 101 with
continued intermittent right-sided neck pain.  she was again
febrile on the morning of admission and called her primary
care physician for his advise.  he suggested that she report
to the emergency department for further evaluation.

in the emergency department, the patient's vital signs
revealed a temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit, her heart
rate was 75, her blood pressure was 93/46, her respiratory
rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.

a chest x-ray in the emergency department showed consistent
cardiomegaly.  an opacity in the right lower lobe with
probable right pleural effusion was identified.  there was no
pneumothorax.  the patient was started on levofloxacin for a
presumed community-acquired pneumonia.  blood cultures were
obtained.

physical examination on presentation:  examination on
admission revealed the patient's temperature was 98.8 degrees
fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 128/70, her heart rate was
74, her respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation
was 95% on room air.  in general, alert and oriented.  she
was in no acute distress.  she was able to talk in complete
sentences comfortably without shortness of breath.  there was
an occasional cough.  head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  the
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  the patient
was edentulous.  the mucous membranes were very dry.  no
lesion in the oropharynx.  the neck was supple.  there was no
tenderness to palpation.  there was no lymphadenopathy.
cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds
approximately halfway up the right lung.  rare left lower
lobe crackles.  the abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  there were positive bowel sounds.  there was
no hepatosplenomegaly.  extremity examination revealed venous
stasis skin changes.  there was no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  the dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ bilaterally.

were intact.  strength was  in the upper and lower
extremities bilaterally.

pertinent laboratory values on presentation:  laboratories on
admission revealed her white blood cell count was 26.2, her
hematocrit was 39.8, and her platelets were 264.
differential revealed 87 neutrophils, 5 bands, 0 lymphocytes,

blood, ph was 6.5, 0 to 2 red blood cells, and a few
bacteria.  urine culture was pending.  blood culture was
pending.

concise summary of hospital course by issue/system:

1.  pulmonary issues:  within the first few days of her
admission, the patient was treated with levofloxacin for a
presumed community-acquired pneumonia.  however, despite
antibiotic treatment, the patient's white blood cell count
remained elevated in the low 20s.  it did trend down slightly
during this time period.

throughout the first few days of her admission, the patient
denied any shortness of breath and had an oxygen saturation
in the mid 90s on room air.

on , a posterior/anterior and lateral chest
x-ray was obtained to re-evaluate the patient's presumed
pneumonia.  in comparison to the admission film, the right
lower lobe opacity had increased in size and intensity.
there was a probable right pleural effusion.  there was also
slightly more prominent pulmonary vessels on the right which
were considered to be positional.  the left lung was
relatively clear at that time with minor atelectasis at the
base.

the following day (on ), a chest computed
tomography was obtained to better visualize the patient's
lungs.  this showed a right loculated pleural effusion with
parietal pleural enhancement and several small gas
reflections.  in addition, there was right lower lobe
atelectasis and consolidation and left upper lobe
ground-glass opacities consistent with a second infectious
process.

at this time, a pulmonary service consultation was obtained.
antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and ceftazidime.  the
patient was taken to interventional pulmonary for placement
of a chest tube on the right to drain the loculated effusion.
following placement of the chest tube, the patient had a
small amount of hemoptysis in interventional pulmonology.  in
addition, her oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on 3 liters
via nasal cannula.  the patient was placed on 100%
nonrebreather with an increase in oxygen saturations to 96%.
at that time, the patient was transferred to the medical
intensive care unit for further care.

in the intensive care unit, the patient's oxygen requirement
rapidly decreased.  however, the chest tube did not drain the
pleural fluid as expected.  it was found to not be in a
sufficient pocket of pleural fluid.  cardiothoracic surgery
was consulted, but the patient and her family wished to avoid
surgery at that time.

therefore, on , the patient was called out
to the floor for further treatment with antibiotics.  her
chest tube was removed.  the patient was treated broadly with
ceftazidime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

a long discussion was held with the patient and her family
regarding the slim possibility of cure of her loculated
infection with antibiotics alone.  however, they continued to
desire to avoid invasive procedures.  they were willing for a
pigtail catheter to be placed in interventional radiology to
see if it could drain some of her pleural effusion, and this
was done on .  fluid continued to drain from
the pigtail catheter over the next several days.  during this
time, the patient's white blood cell count remained elevated
but she was afebrile and had good oxygen saturations on room
air.

however, despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and drainage from
the pigtail catheter, the patient's white blood cell count
was still significantly elevated on  at
22,000.  at that time, the family spoke to the cardiac
surgery and decided to proceed with a video-assisted thoracic
surgery.  the patient underwent the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure on .  following the
procedure, she was initially extubated.  however, in the
recovery unit, the patient developed hypotension to a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s requiring treatment with
neo-synephrine, acute respiratory distress with desaturations
to the low 90s on face mask, and was eventually reintubated
and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for
further management.

the patient was successfully extubated in the medical
intensive care unit the next day (on ).  the
patient was returned to the general medical floor later that
day and has done well since that time.  at the time of this
dictation, the patient was saturating in the mid to high 90s
on room air.  in addition, her white blood cell count
continued to decrease following the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure.  on  her white blood cell
count was 11.5.  her chest tube was removed on  without difficulty.

an infectious and cytologic workup had been pursued on the
fluid drained through the chest tube and pigtail catheter.
in addition, specimens were sent during the video-assisted
thoracic surgery procedure.  at the time of this dictation,
the fluid obtained on  grew scant
gram-positive rods.  all other cultures have been negative to
date.  cytology specimens were negative for malignant cells.
final report of pleural tissue pathology was still pending.

2.  neck pain issues:  a wide differential was considered on
admission for the patient's right-sided neck pain.  the
patient had the neck pain only she was spiking fevers.  it
was not reproducible on examination.

two days into the  hospital course, her neck pain
resolved spontaneously and has not returned.

3.  hypertension issues:  on admission, the patient was
continued on her home dose of lisinopril with good blood
pressure control.  following the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure, the patient became hypotensive in the
recovery unit and required pressors.  however, her blood
pressure quickly returned to a normal range.  she was
re-initiated on lisinopril 5 mg by mouth once per day on
.

4.  depression issues:  the patient was continued on
sertraline throughout her hospital course.

5.  parkinson disease with  body dementia issues:  this
was stable throughout the  hospital course.  the
patient does not take any medications for this condition.

6.  rehabilitation issues:  physical therapy worked with the
patient as tolerated during her admission.

7.  fluids/electrolytes/nutrition issues:  the patient was
maintained on a low-sodium diet.  her potassium and magnesium
were repleted as needed.

8.  prophylaxis issues:  the patient was maintained on
subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
pantoprazole for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.  senna and
colace for a bowel regimen.  the patient was placed on a
nicotine patch during her admission to avoid withdrawal given
her long smoking history.

9.  code status issues:  at this time, the patient is do not
resuscitate/do not intubate.  her family is very involved in
the medical decision making.

condition at discharge:  condition on discharge was stable.

discharge status:  the patient was to be discharged to
.  she is currently saturating
in the mid 90s on room air.  she was afebrile, and her white
blood cell count was trending down.  the patient reported

## gi bleed: pt's hematocrit has been stable while in house and
no further evidence of gi bleeding.  etiology could have been
small   tear vs gastritis.  pt has no evidence of
cirrhosis by physical exam or labs.  he was maintained on iv ppi
twice a day and denied any further gi sx's.  he will be
discharged on once a day oral protonix.  scope was initially

## etoh withdrawal: pt states has had dt's in past.  initially
placed in icu for closer monitoring, where he required large
doses of benzodiazapines for withdrawl (hundreds of milligrams
of valium).  he was also started on scheduled haldol, which he

now with suspected withdrawal seizure requring high benzo doses.


1. etoh withdrawl:

history of etoh abuse and withdrawal seizure.  he was
intoxicated in the ed and
had a witnessed seizure in that context.  he received in total
about 100mg of valium while in the ed.  he was transferred to
the  icu for further monitoring.  he was monitored by ciwa
scale, and required minimal further benzodiazepines.  he
consistently had scores by ciwa scale of 0-2 and had no further
signs/symptoms of withdrawal. he had no further seizures during
his hospital course.

2. acid-base: primary hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic
alkalosis likely  vomiting, contraction. ag 22 c/w metabolic
acidosis likely uremic. lactate wnl 2.2.
these acid/base disturbances, as well as hypokalemia and
hypomagnesemia were all corrected with volume resuscitation and
electrolyte repletion.

3. rll opacity:

persistent lung nodule in rll seen on chest xray.  initially
started on abx in
ed, but these were d/c in icu, as there was no clear evidence of
infection.  a chest ct was performed, which demonstrated a 3cm
spiculated rll nodule, concerning for malignancy, especially
given his smoking history. he will need further f/u and
diagnostic biopsy.  the team discussed the lesion with mr.
, clearly stating that there was a high chance it was
malignant and the best chance of cure would be excision.  mr.
 indicated he understood and would follow up at a clinic
appointment the team set up for him prior to his discharge.

4. arf:

consistent with pre-renal azotemia. resolved with aggressive
volume resuscitation.
no further issues.

5. follow up:

complicated social situation with tenuous housing; lives on
street as well as with children.  seen by sw while in house;
offered etoh counseling/programs, but patient refused.  he will
f/u with dr.   in  clinic; on discharge, this
appointment was set up.  he will need to apply for masshealth
coverage as well.
he agreed to f/u, and understands that he needs further f/u for
this lung nodule.

tremulousness. given 40mg valium in ed. admitted to  and
started on valium ciwa scale. started on folate, thiamine, mvi.
monitored on telemetry overnight. he had no evidence of seizure
or hd instabilitiy o/n. his ciwa was , mainly based on
agitation and tremulousness, and he recieved an additional 120mg
valium overnight. early on hd 2 the patient demanded to leave.
it was explained to the patient that he has a high probability
of withdrawal seizure or dt's and that he needed continued icu
monitoring. the patient reported that he understood this but
still wished to leave against medical advice. he was felt to
have capacity to make this decision since he had no evidence of
delirium and clearly understood his situation and risks
involved. the case was discussed with the on call psychiatry
resident, icu medicine resident and icu staff attending.
therefore the patient signed out ama on hospital day 2. prior to
discharge we did have him ambulate around the intensive care
unit and he was able to do this without too much difficuluty,
although he was still a bit tremulous upon discharge. he had no
other evidence of active w/d symptoms.

2. anion-gap acidosis: suspected secondary to ketoacidosis,
likely from poor po intake. etoh was negative suggesting against
etoh related cause. serum acetone was positive, with a normal
serum osm. his gap closed with ivf hydration.

3. hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis: secondary to hcl loss from
vomiting. improved with ivf hydration.

4. hematemesis: limited hematemesis early the morning of
admission. he had no further episodes of blood loss and he was
guaiac negative on admission. hematocrit remained stable
overnight.

5. abd pain: suspect secondary to chronic pancreatitis.
amylase/lipase unchanged from previous levels. ast/alt 2:1 in
setting of h/o etoh abuse. recent ct () negative for liver
or gb dx, only fatty liver.

6. rll lung mass: seen on chest ct from , concerning for

the patient was treated for hyponatremia with 3% saline solution
in the medical intensive care unit. per the renal consult team
recommendations, the patient was placed on free water
restriction to 1l per day and 3% saline was infused at 40cc/hr
via picc, with a goal of increasing the serum sodium by 
meq/hour or <12 meq/24 hrs. over this initial 24 hours of
admission the patient's serum sodium increased from 114 to 119.
on day 3 of admission 3% saline solution was discontinued and
the patient was transfered to the floor. the nephrology team
that was consulted initially continued to follow the patient
during this admission and determined that the hyponatremia was
hctz-induced. the patient's serum sodium normalized with the
withdrawal of hctz and an siadh work-up was not pursued, per
renal recommendations.

free fluid, blood in the left renal pelvis with blood in the
ureter. there is a small liver laceration and a sacral
fracture as well as left iliac  small fracture.

hospital course:  patient was admitted to the trauma
intensive care unit for close observation. patient was seen
by the  service and was recommended to have a
nephrostomy tube placed which was done. there was difficulty
with the initial nephrostomy tube, and interventional
radiology inserted the nephrostomy tube.

patient was seen by the thoracic surgery service for the
bilateral pneumothoraces. chest tubes were attempted, but
unable to be passed due to scarring and the lungs cleared.
patient was seen by the orthopedic spine service as well. it
was determined that the c2 fracture would require a hard
collar for at least 8-12 weeks.

patient was in the trauma intensive care unit with
hematocrits being followed serially. on the evening of
, patient's serial hematocrits were significantly
altered. patient dropped her blood pressure, became
hemodynamically stable, and the hematocrit was in the mid
teen's. it was decided at this time patient will be brought
to the emergency room emergently to have an open splenectomy.

postoperatively, the patient was again brought to the trauma
intensive care unit. we gradually weaned the patient from the

had some sputum samples which revealed some gram-negative
rods for which she was started on levofloxacin. a 14-day
course of that was to be initiated. patient was started on
nutrition with promod with fiber by dobbhoff feeding tube. a
percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on 
successfully.

on the last few days in the intensive care unit, patient was
able to wean to a tracheostomy collar. this was tolerated
well. speech and swallow was done the day of discharge, which
a passy-muir valve was not tolerated for extended periods of

brief hospital course:
id: patient has been consistently febrile, initially started on
vancomycin and zosyn for presumed pneumonia, sputum cultures and

blood cultures positive for yeast. she was treated with
meropenam, vancomycin, flagyl, and then on  caspofungin
added. she continues to be febrile. since  blood cultures
have been negative, sputum continues to grow yeast.

gi: on  she was noted to have rise in her lft's and
abdominal
tenderness, she was taken to the or for an exploratory
laparotomy
and found to have an ischemic colonic perforation. r colectomy
and ileostomy placement was performed at that time. she is still

not receiving feeds through the g tube.

heme: initially anemic, now hct has been stable in mid-20's.

neuro: pt when admitted on  was noted to follow commands and

express pain. she was on her home regimen of paxil for anxiety.
on day of admission she was started on propofol for agitation,
it
caused hypotension and it was weaned. she was at that time noted

to be sedated but still following commands. on  she was
switched to a versed drip. on  she was unarousable, versed
stopped and only given morphine prn. she was noted on  to
follow commands and awake and alert.  went to the or, and
afterwards was treated with propofol and fentanyl. on  she
was noted to have minial movement of her lue and none of her
rue,
but moved both lower extremities in response to pain. on 
she
was reported to be following commands and responding to
painful
stimuli. she has been on a fentanyl drip until , when she
was
switched to a fentanyl patch. on  fentanyl patch was d/c'ed
and she has only been receiving fentanyl prn dressing changes.
today, it was noted that despite being off sedation for several
days, she has not been awake or following commands initially
however this status has continues to improve and patient had
remained afebrile on trach trial up to 5 hours, she will need
continued wound care to incision with wet to dry dressing

the pulmonary vascularity is normal. there is some crowding of
vessels in the lower lung zones likely related to the low lung
volumes. a slightly more patchy area of opacity is seen in the
infrahilar region on the lateral view likely due to crowding of
vascular structures. no pleural effusions are identified.

within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is a
paucity of bowel gas suggesting underlying ascites.

impression:
1. low lung volumes. no definite pneumonia, but repeat study may
be helpful to fully exclude basilar pneumonia on this low lung
volume radiograph.

reason for this examination:
please place temporary ij dialysis catheter on 
clinical information: 76-year-old man with cirrhosis of the
liver, status post gi bleed, renal failure, needs temporal
dialysis catheter placement for hemodialysis.

procedure/findings: the procedure was performed by dr.  
and dr. . dr. , the attending radiologist, was
present and supervising throughout the procedure.

after the risks and benefits were explained to the patient,
written informed consent was obtained. the patient was placed
supine on the angiographic table. the right neck was prepped and
draped in the standard sterile fashion. ultrasound confirmed the
right internal jugular vein was patent and compressible. a
preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the patient's name,
procedure, and the site. 5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for
local anesthesia. under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge
needle was used to access the right internal jugular vein. a
0.018 guide wire was placed through the needle under
fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in the superior vena cava.
the needle was exchanged for a 4-french micropuncture sheath.
the wire was exchanged for a 0.035 guide wire under fluoroscopic
guidance with the tip in the inferior vena cava. the
micropuncture sheath was removed. the venous access was dilated
by using 12- and 14-french dilators. a 20-cm hemodialysis
catheter was placed over the wire with the tip in the right
atrium. the wire was removed. two lumens were flushed, and the
catheter was secured with skin with sutures.

the patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no
immediate complications.

during the procedure, two ultrasound films were taken.

impression: successful placement of a 20-cm, temporal
hemodialysis catheter through right internal jugular vein with
the tip in the right atrium. the catheter is ready to use.

dialysis intiiated, also received large volume paracentesis with
removal of 1.1 l. his clinical status deteriorated due to
worsening cirrhosis and renal failure, and he was made cmo prior
to transfer to hospice.
.
#. acute on chronic renal failure. patient likely had arf from
hepatorenal syndrome, triggered by intravascular volume
depletion from large volume paracentesis done several days prior
to admission, with contribution from ugib during his admission.
renal ultrasound has been negative for obstruction, urine
electrolytes  sodium c/w hrs, and urine sediment bland.
urine eosinophils negative, less concerning for atn as cause.
patient received 500cc ns challenge on day of admission, with no
improvement in his renal function.  patient was initiated on
hemodialysis and received three sessions with minimal
improvement in renal function. he was placed on nephrocaps, and
given octreotide and midodrine for treatment of hrs. he was
given albumin 12.5 mg twice daily. his diuretics were held.
.
#. gi bleeding. patient had an episode of coffee grounds emesis
in the ed, with hx grade ii esophageal varices. he again had an
episode of upper gi bleeding while on the floor, and was
transferred to the micu.
in the micu, the patient received 2 units of blood and underwent
gastric banding for variceal bleeds.  he was continued on
octreotide gtt for 5 days and started on carafate. after the
banding, pt did not develop any further hematemasis, however, pt
received two more units for hct drop.  he was started on full
liquid diet. he was then transferred to the floor, where he was
stable for the next several days. he had an active t&s, and was
on protonix and carafate, scheduled for repeat endoscopy two
weeks later. on day prior to discharge, patient again started
vomiting up guaiac positive material. kub showed an ileus, with
likely vomiting of feculent material mixed with blood. there was
no indication of active bleeding.

#. scrotal edema. patient c/o pain and tenderness at foley
insertion site, and his foley was discontinued. he was not
having any urine output and received intermittent straight
catheterizations with minimal urine output. these were
discontinued as well due to patient discomfort. bladder scan was
not reliable for urine in bladder due to increased ascites.
patient's pain was controlled with morphine, viscous lidocaine,

history of present illness:
ms.  is a 69 year-old female with a history of
diabetes, coronary artery disease, copd who presents on transfer
for respiratory distress.
.
per review of osh records:  patient presented to osh with
complaints of  days of cough and dyspnea.  on the day prior
to transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset
of worsened dyspnea.  she asked bystanders to call ems and by
the time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a
pulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.
.
at the osh, initial cxr showed congestive heart failure.  she
was given iv lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  after several
hundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,
requiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  for a
possible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
she was transfused one unit of prbc for a hct of 29.  an echo
done at the osh showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly
preserved lvef.
.
in speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six
months the patient's asthma has been under excellent control.
she was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  it was
felt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home
environment which had previously been infested with mold.  over
the last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought
to her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes
had contained mold and were the precipitant for her current
exacerbation.

brief hospital course:
assessment/plan :
69 female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease,
diabetes who present with respiratory distress, nstemi, acute
renal failure, currently vented.
.
1. respiratory failure:
pulmonary dysfunction/reactive airway disease: the most likely
etiology of the precipitating event in this patient is a severe
exaccerbation of her known reactive airway disease. regarding
precipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing
and could also explain the cxr findings if it is felt that they
represent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  other
more typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,
pe (see below) and others.  the patient is was intubated and
vented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the
ventilator. initially with respiratory acidosis with poor o2 due
to vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.
patient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the
continued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due
to demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory
hold), and current cardiac disease. despite aggressive
bronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she
continued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial
sedation and paralysis. patient per report was tolerating the
ventilator at the outside hospital.  it was unclear what was
causing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. after
episode  patient required paralysis.   patient
esophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a
need for peep of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. patient
tolerated peep to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped
paralytics and lightened sedation.  patient with prolonged
expiratory phase and stomach/chf grunt during this time period
and ce positive (pao2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back
on paralytics. while paralyzed  problem with lung resistence.
attempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to
wean her peep, but she continued to need paralysis.  a decision
was made to attempt a pa catheter for better understanding of
her hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.
during this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent
arrhythmia noted.  she was able to be resuscitated, but required
ventricular pacing.  her family then decided to withdraw care
and ventilator support.  she subsequently expired from cardiac
failure.
.
2. nstemi / cad: patient has had three coronary events.
at osh in setting of hypotension, troponin to 0.6, felt to be
demand ischemia. here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was
stopped .  per the son, the patient has not had any chest
pain.
here  o/n patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.
tachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend
down in response to fluids. ruled in for nstemi (ck 2895, mb 64,
troponin 1.26). on  o/n patient weaned off sedation, became
agitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, ce from the time
on the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ecg
sinus lbbb with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating
concordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to
. transfused one unit prbcs for ischemia with hct <30. she
was continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and
metoprolol. cardiology was following during her stay.
.
3: congestive heart failure: patient has had multiple espisodes
of desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean
sedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. ,
patient oxygenation and cxr responded very well to diuresis.
patient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and
hypotension(toponin  1.26). demonstrated during this that
patient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia
causing chf.  she was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg tid
and diuresed as tolerated.
.
4. leukocytosis: white blood cell count increasing, patient
afebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.
in the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious
for pna. must also consider stress response with recent
nstemi/demand, episode where patient was found down vs
alternative sources for infection.  also be due to increased
steroids for patient pulmonary presentation. legionella osh
negative. she was treated empirically for pneumonia.
.
5. hyperglycemia / diabetes:
was quite hyperglycemic at the osh.  she was covered with at
 insulin gtt. patient amylase and lipase were within normal
limits. attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for
patient pulmonary disease.
.
6. acute renal failure: at baseline.
most likely flow related given recent hypotension. admitted with
renal failure, with urine lytes with feurea 15.6% suggesting
pre-renal etiology. initial improvement with fluids. feel
patient at baseline (1-1.5).
.
7. metabolic acidosis: resolved
patient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant
amount of lactate and had a coronary event. when accounting for
bicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. gave
back bicarbonate as one liter d5 with 3 amps of bicarb  am.
patient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps
bicarbonate .
.
8. hypotension: given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be
diuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute chf with
hypotension. hypertension upon arrival to . hypotension with
intubation. hypotension  o/n. hypotensive  o/n in
setting of 2 l urine output on lasix and cardiac event. improved
with decreased in peep from 18-14.
.
9. tachycardia:
reoccurred in the setting of hypotension and nstemi.
on admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to
pain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.   be
component of volume depletion as well. with improved sedation
and ivf boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic . only
concern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress
in relatively sedentary patient is pe. although at this point
low suspicion given physical exam, and negative lenis.  she was
given metoprolol for rate control.

pertinent radiology/imaging:  electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 57 beats per minute.

a chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary processes.

summary of hospital course:  as stated previously, the
patient was a direct admission to the operating room on  where she underwent minimally invasive mitral valve repair
via a right mid axillary mini-anterior thoracotomy with a
28-mm  angioplasty.  please see the operative report
for full details.

in summary, the patient had a minimally invasive mitral valve
repair.  her bypass time was 130 minutes with a cross-clamp
time of 110 minutes.  she tolerated the operation well and
was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic
intensive care unit.  at the time of transfer, the patient's
mean arterial pressure was 74 with a central venous pressure
of 6.  she was in a sinus rhythm at 89 beats per minute.  she
had a levophed infusion at 0.3 mcg/kg per minute and propofol
at 20 mcg/kg per minute.

the patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
her anesthesia was reversed.  she was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  she had no other
events on operative day.

on postoperative day one, the patient continued to require a
levophed infusion for blood pressure support which was
titrated as tolerated.  her swan-ganz catheter was removed on
postoperative day two.  the patient had weaned to off the
levophed infusion, and she was transferred to the floor for
continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

additionally, on postoperative day two, the  
drain was removed.  over the next several days, the patient
had an uneventful hospitalization.

once on the floor, with the assistance of the nursing staff
and the physical therapy staff, the patient's activity level
was advanced.  she remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her hospitalization.

on postoperative day four, it was decided that the patient
was stable and ready to be discharged to home.  at that time,
the patient's physical examination was as follows.  vital
signs revealed her temperature was 99, her heart rate was 92
(sinus rhythm), her blood pressure was 104/68, her
respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on
room air.  her weight preoperatively was 59 kilograms, at
discharge was 66.7 kilograms.

history of present illness:
ms.  is an 80yo woman with h/o cad s/p recent pci, severe
as s/p valvuloplasty , and recently treated for possible
pneumonia with ceftazidime  admitted with shortness of
breath and hypotension.

ms.  husband reports that he has observed her breathing
very fast around 3 or 4 in the morning for the last couple of
nights.  on the day of admissin, she woke up short of breath and
breathing quickly.  he used a stethoscope (which he has to help
with home maintenance) and heard a hissing/wheezing on her right
chest, which prompted him to call 911.  she continued breathing
fast until she was intubated in the ed with her consent.  he
notes that she has had a minimally productive cough since her
last admission, though she has not had fevers or chills.  she
had diarrhea for about a day recently, but this has resolved.
her nephrologist contact her on  and advised her to
decrease her lasix from 160mg daily to 80mg because of her
rising creatinine.  despite this change, her daily weight has
remained stable at 119-120 pounds.  she has been compliant with
1l fluid restriction.

in the ed, her initial vs were:  99.8   115   122/75   30s   82%
nrb.  she was noted to have crackles on her pulmonary exam.  she
was given rocuronium, etomidate, and versed and intubated
urgently.  shortly after propofol gtt was started, she dropped
her pressures into the into the 70s (per report; recorded in the
80s).  bedside echo was done to evaluate for concern of
tamponade.  echo demonstrated large anterior fat pad and stable
small loculated pericardial effusion.  left cordis was placed
for hypotension; there was concern that the line might be in the
carotid, and ct was done to confirm placement.  radiology
reports that the line is in the left brachiocephalic vein.
pressures increased to 110s after 500cc iv fluid bolus.  she
received vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone in the ed.

on review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
tia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. she denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. she denies
exertional buttock or calf pain.

cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  +3 pillow
orthopnea, although she tends to move to flat position during
sleep.  she does not sore and her husband denies witnessed
apneas, though she has never had a formal evaluation.

right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
the aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). the
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild to moderate

the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
underestimated.] there is a small, primarily anterior
pericardial effusion most prominent around the right atrium and
right ventricle with a prominent anterior fat pad. no right
atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen (may be
absent in the setting of pulmonary artery hypertension).

left
brachiocephalic vein without immediate post-procedure
complications.
2. diffuse bilateral septal thickening and ground-glass
opacities with
associated small bilateral pleural effusions suggesting moderate
pulmonary
edema. bibasilar atelectasis and coexistent pneumonia cannot be
excluded and should be clinically correlated.

brief hospital course:
80yo woman with severe as, chf, cri, admitted with respiratory
failure likely  acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure.
she was diuresed with lasix, improving her respiratory function
to the point where she no longer required supplemental oxygen,
but subsequently developed crao, leading to stroke workup and
anticoagulation with heparin, leading to gib due to esophagitis
and gastritis, leading to transfusion for dropping hematocrit,
leading to acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to
volume overload.
.
# respiratory failure  acute on chronic heart failure:
presented in respiratory distress with sao2 82% on nrb.
respiratory failure most likely multifactorial, involving
chronic heart failure due to aortic stenosis, exacerbated
acutely by volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of
decreased lasix dosage. intubated in ed, extubated on hospital
day 2. continued to require 4lnc, desaturating to 80s on room
air. diuresed with multiple boluses of lasix iv. gradually
weaned to room air, with o2 saturation in mid to high 90s while
resting, but desaturating deeply to upper 80s with ambulation.
unfortunately, she subsequently developed a gib, leading to
transfusion of multiple units of prbcs, resulting in shifts in
volume status and worsening oxygen saturations and increasing
need for supplemental oxygen. she was once again diuresed with
multiple doses of lasix iv, at times requiring combination with
metolazone. she was gradually weaned off of oxygen until she no
longer required supplemental oxygen and was euvolemic on exam.
.
# gib:
vomited a large quantity of blood after starting heparin. has a
history of gastritis on recent admission in . gi was
consulted and egd done, showing gastritis and esophagitis but no
frank bleeding. she was started on an iv ppi and antiemetics.
she was initially transfused two units of blood in the setting
of the acute bleed, and subsequently received another unit for
gradually decreasing hematocrit. of note, even before her
episode of acute gib, her stools were noted to be guaiac
positve. gi felt that given that the gib occurred in the setting
of being started on heparin and having a previous history of
gastritis, there was no need to arrange for gi follow up unless
she desired.
.
# central retinal artery occlusion:
awoke one afternoon with sudden loss of vision in r eye.
ophthalmology was consulted and diagnosed patient with likely
crao. paracentesis was performed to lower intraocular pressure.
neurology consulted for stroke workup. ct and mri showed signs
of old ischemia and infarction but no acute events. started on
heparin drip for concern about emboli, but heparin discontinued
for gib. carotid ultrasound showed thrombus in l ij, possibly
related to recently removed cordis, but otherwise no significant
stenosis. an appointment was made for her to follow up with a
retinal specialist. of note, she reports that she is already
followed by a retinal specialist at the meei for her macular
degeneration.
.
# aortic stenosis:
currently s/p recent valvuloplasty, with valve area 0.9cm.
evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery - felt to be poor surgical
candidate, both for valve replacement and for apico-aortic
conduit, given significantly calcified aorta, small body habitus
and poor renal function. cardiothoracic surgery recommended
considering enrollment in percutaneous valve trial.
.
# renal failure:
in consultation with renal team, it was felt that it was
necessary to diurese the patient in order to improve her
pulmonary status. baseline cr 1.3-2.5 over last month.
creatinine increased to 2.7 initially, but subsequently improved
with continued diuresis. hd line removed on hospital day 2 for
gram positive cocci on blood cultures (she required hemodialysis
in , but has not required it since). the patient was diuresed
to a creatinine of 2.4 on the day of discharge so that she would
be slightly dry on discharge and therefore euvolemic on her home
diet.
.
# infection:
initial ed blood culture grew viridans streptococcus, resistant
to penicillin. hd line tip culture grew staphylococcus aureus,
resistant to oxacillin, sensitive to vancomycin. pt was treated
with vancomycin starting in the ed. per infectious disease
consult, due to possibility of endocarditis (absence of
vegetations on tee did not rule out endocarditis), given blood
culture with viridans streptococci, the pt will require
treatment with 6 weeks of vancomycin for viridans streptococcus.
she will require vancomycin, dosed for troughs of under 20,
until . a picc line was placed for administration of
antibiotics to treat possible endocarditis.
.
# anemia:
hct gradually decreased from near 30 to 20.1 in first day in
ccu.  transfused two units prbcs to post transfusion hematocrit
26.5. has h/o diverticulosis and gastritis. stools guaiacs were
positive. subsequently transfused two units immediately
following gib, and then another unit for gradually decreasing
hematocrit. hematocrit was stable at 32 on discharge.
.
# mobility:
evaluated by physical therapy. will receive pt at home.

discharge disposition:
home with service

facility:
 homecare

discharge diagnosis:
primary diagnosis:
acute respiratory failure secondary to acute congestive heart
failure
septicemia
central retinal artery occlusion
gastrointestinal bleeding due to esophagitis/gastritis
.
secondary diagnoses:
aortic stenosis
coronary artery disease
pulmonary edema
chronic renal insufficiency
hypertension
anemia with chronic gi bleed
scoliosis


discharge condition:
stable vital signs with appropriate follow-up.


discharge instructions:
you were admitted with acute respiratory distress due to fluid
in your lungs. when you initially presented, you required
intubation and mechanical ventilation to provide you with
adequate oxygenation.

your aortic stenosis (which is the narrowing of one of your
heart valves) makes it very difficult to manage your fluid
status. you were evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery to see if
they would suggest replacing your aortic valve, but they felt
that you would not be a good candidate for surgery because of
your other medical conditions, which would make surgery
extremely risky.

you were treated with lasix to decrease the amount of fluid in
your lungs, improving your ability to breathe. your ability to
breathe gradually improved to the point that you did not require
supplemental oxygen.

you developed a loss of vision in your right eye. you were seen
by an ophthalmologist who made a small hole in your eye to drain
some fluid and diagnosed you with likely central retinal artery
occlusion, a condition in which a vessel supplying blood to the
eye becomes clogged. you were started on anticoagulation with
heparin.

you developed a gastrointestinal bleed, vomiting a quantity of
blood and having a number of maroon colored stools. you were
seen by a gastrointestinologist who performed an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, showing esophagitis and gastritis.
heparin was discontinued and you were started on iv proton pump
inhibitors.

a sample of your blood showed that you had an infection in your
blood with a bacteria known as viridans streptococci. you were
initially started on ceftriaxone, an antibiotic, to treat this
bacteria. because the particular bacteria you were infected with
turned out to be resistant to penicillin, the ceftriaxone was
discontinued and you were treated with vancomycin. you will
require treatment with vancomycin for a total of six weeks,
until . a picc line, a special type of iv line, was
placed so that you can continue to receive the vancomycin at
home.

your hemodialysis catheter was removed. because you had not
required dialysis recently, it was felt that the catheter was
not necessary. the tip of the cathether was noted to have
another type of bacteria on it, staphylococcus aureus. this
bacteria was resistant to many antibiotics and required
treatment with vancomycin. you were treated with vancomycin for
the staphylococcus aureus. this infection required only
treatment for 5-7 days, so this bacteria has probably been
adequately treated already.

when you first were admitted to the hospital, your kidneys were
functioning poorly. your creatinine, which increases when your
kidneys are not working well, reached a peak of 2.7. as we
treated you with lasix and decreased the amount of fluid in your
body, your kidney function actually improved.

you were noted to be somewhat anemic. when you first came in,
your hematocrit was near 30. it gradually dropped to
approximately 20.  you were given two units of blood, and your
hematocrit increased to the upper 20s. subsequently, your
hematocrit dropped again after you had your gi bleed. you were
again transfused two units of blood. a few days later, your
hematocrit was noted to trend down, so you were transfused
another unit.

1. please take all medications as prescribed.
***medication changes:***
your aspirin was changed to 81mg daily. your carvedilol was
increased and your prilosec increased to twice daily. your
cozaar is being held because of your renal function. vancomycin
was started to treat bacteria in your blood. sevelamer was
started to regulate the phosphate level in your blood as your
kidneys are not working as well to remove it.

2. please attend all follow-up appointments listed below.

3. please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you
develop chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness,
decreased urine output, or any other concerning symptom.

4. please weigh yourself every morning and call your doctor if
your weight goes up by 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.

5. please limit yourself to a 2 gm sodium diet; written
information was reviewed with you about your diet.

6. please limit your fluid intake to a fluid restriction of
1000ml/day.

7. while you are on the vancomycin, you will need to have weekly
labs drawn and faxed to the infectious disease doctors

brief hospital course:
pt was admitted with presumed chf exacerbation most likely
secondary to increased dietary salt intake and severe aortic
stenosis. pt was diursed and treated with o2.


chr exacerbation:
patient was diuresed.  she was initially started on antibiotics
for question on pneumonia which were then stopped after her
white count normalized.

she was continued on her iv vancomycin course which was started
at a previous hospital stay for strep viridans bacteremia. she
was afebrile for the duration of her stay.  the patient was
diursed and treated with oxygen and improved.  pt has prior hx
of gi bleed and had heme positive stools.  her hct remained
stable throughout her hospitalization.  she received 2 units of
prbc for a hct of 23, which was later determined to be near her
baseline of 25.

she was discharged in stable condition to home with home oxygen
as she had ambulatory desats to 87%.  she has follow with her
pcp for  of her vancomycin levels and follow with with
gi for colonoscopy.  she was also instructed to follow up with
her cardiologist for managment of congestive heart failure and
her neprologist for her kidney failure.

her carvelilol was increased to 21.5mg twice a day and her
neurontin was changed to 300mg every other day.  she was resumed
on all her other home medications.

coronary artery disease:
pt with history of cad and has had presious stent.  her cardiac
enzymes were negative and there were no ecg changes.  her ace-i
was held in the setting of her acute renal failure, she was
continued on her aspirin and beta blocker.

aortic stenosis:
her severe aortic stenosis was thought to be a contributing
factor to her current chf exacerbation.  she has had a past
valvuloplasty and was determinted not to be a candidate for any
further intervention at this time

strep viridans bacteremia:
she had a rencent echocardiogram that was negative for
endocarditis.  her blood cultures were negative for her length
of stay.  she remained on vancomycin.

gi bleed: pt had guiac positive, melanotic stools.  she remained
on her ppi and was set up with dr.  as an outpatient for
colonoscopy.

renal failure: baseline cr appears to be close to 1.6 but her cr
has been fluctuating up to 2.7 on prior admission. she continues
to have good urine output and her cr trended down.

: upper gi endoscopy - according to the gi fellow, they
had found several bleeding avm's at the gastric and duodenal
border similar to an endoscopy done a month prior.  gi was able
to cauterize 3 of the avm's.


brief hospital course:
this is a 80yo woman with h/o cad s/p recent des to lcx and as
s/p valvuloplasty admitted on  for another chf exacerbation,
receiving diuresis/hd, pt course was complicated by gi bleeding,
underwent dialysis prior to leaving.  it was decided that the
patient was not a candidate for surgical intervention of the
stenotic valve at this time.
.
# chf exacerbation: the patient had several episodes of
desaturation and acute shortness of breath.  the patient was
given progressive doses of lasix, typically iv at 100mg.  she
became refractory to lasix dosing and required priming with
diuril.  the patient was transferred from ccu to the floor, at
which point she developed both acute shortness of breath and
progressive hematemesis which prompted her return back to the
ccu.  she developed renal failure shortly thereafter, and
required hemodialysis.  after frequent dialysis, the pt. is now
satting at 98% on 4l and is fairly comfortable.
.
# coronary artery disease: des to lcx in , other
coronaries w/o obstructive dz. no evidence of acute ischemic
changes during admission.  the patient had been receiving asa
and plavix along with carvedilol, the asa and plavix were
discontinued after the episode of upper gi bleeding.
.
# aortic stenosis: s/p valvuloplasty, not thought to be good
surgical candidate due to large atheroma.  no realistic
percutaneous option as patient has 4 exclusion criteria for most
feasible trial.  last tte  w/aortic valvular area of 0.5
cm2.
.
# id issues: pt recently ended course of vancomycin for strep
veridins bacteremia.  blood and urine cultures have been
negative, tte negative for any endocarditis.  urine cultures
negative with postitive ua.  the patient had her foley removed
and she completed a course of cipro for 5 days.
.
# upper gi bleed: the patient devleped retching and hematemesis
on , which was similar to an episode a month earlier.  at
that time she was scoped and found to have multiple bleeding
avm's which were cauterized and had a stable hct.  at this time,
the patient was found to again have multiple avm's which were
bleeding.  the patient was transferred back to the icu after a
hematocrit drop of over 7 to 19, was given 3 units of blood.
she summarily went into flash pulmonary edema with concomitant
renal failure, and had to be dialyzed.  the patient was given 1
more unit of blood and placed on epo before discharge, hct has
been stable at baseline of 26 for the 48 hours prior to
discharge.
.
# acute on chronic renal failure:  the patient had been
responsive to high doses of lasix (100mg) with diuril priming.
however, when the patient developed hematemesis and had an acute
blood loss, she subsequently developed renal failure, and when
she had a subsequent episode of flash pulmonary edema, she
received urgent dialysis and a tunnelled hd line was placed.
she received dialysis prior to discharge, and had been followed
by dr. .
