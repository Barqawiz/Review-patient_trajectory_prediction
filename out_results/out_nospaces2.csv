history of present illness this is an eighty one year old female with a history of emphysema not on home o two who presents with three days of shortness of breath thought by her primary care doctor to be a copd flare two days prior to admission she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain oxygen saturation greater than ninety percent she has also been on levofloxacin and nebulizers and was not getting better and presented to the emergency room 
in the emergency room her oxygen saturation was one hundred percent on cpap she was not able to be weaned off of this despite nebulizer treatment and solu medrol one hundred twenty five mg iv x two 
review of systems is negative for the following fevers chills nausea vomiting night sweats change in weight gastrointestinal complaints neurologic changes rashes palpitations orthopnea is positive for the following chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with exertion some shortness of breath that is positionally related but is improved with nebulizer treatment 
past medical history 
copd last pulmonary function tests in demonstrated a fvc of fifty two percent of predicted a fev one of fifty four percent of predicted a mmf of twenty three percent of predicted and a fev one fvc ratio of sixty seven percent of predicted that does not improve with bronchodilator treatment the fvc however does significantly improve with bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive ventilatory defect the patient has never been on home oxygen prior to this recent episode she has never been on steroid taper or been intubated in the past 
lacunar cva mri of the head in demonstrates mild degree of multiple small foci of high t two signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres as well as the pons in the latter region predominantly to the right of midline the abnormalities while nonspecific in etiology are most likely secondary to chronic microvascular infarction there is no mass lesion shift of the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus the major vascular flow patterns are preserved there is moderate right maxillary moderate bilateral ethmoid mild left maxillary minimal right sphenoid and frontal sinus mucosal thickening these abnormalities could represent an allergic or some other type of inflammatory process additionally noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella turcica 
angina most recent stress test was in going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of ten zerozerozero sixty four percent of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence of ischemic ekg changes or symptoms the imaging portion of the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and a calculated ejection fraction of eighty four percent the patient denies angina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks are alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin

brief summary of hospital course 
copddyspneapneumonia the patient was initially placed on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical intensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation despite cpap machine she was also given nebulizer treatments q point four h as well as chest pt the nebulizers were increased to q point one h due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathing 
due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing the patient was intubated on in order to improve oxygenation ventilation and ability to suction a bronchoscopy was performed on which demonstrated marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent with tracheomalacia 
on two silicone stents were placed one in the left main stem twelve x twenty five and one in the trachea sixteen x fourty by dr under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia 
on the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel mask and her oxygen was titrated down to two liters nasal cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical floor on the medical floor the steroids were weaned to off on and the patient was saturating at ninety seven percent on two liters ninety two percent on room air 
on the patient was seen again by the interventional pulmonology service who agreed that she looked much improved and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with followup within six weeks time status post placement of stents in respiratory failure 
cardiovascular the patient was ruled out for a mi she did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain which showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative troponin negative cks x three she was continued on aspirin imdur and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient regimen 
hypertension she was maintained on diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and normalization of electrolytes 
hematuria the patient had intermittent hematuria likely secondary to foley placement the foley catheter was discontinued on she had serial urinalyses which were all negative for signs of infection 
hyperglycemia patient was placed on insulin sliding scale due to hyperglycemia which was steroid induced this worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels once the steroids were tapered to off 
leukocytosis patient did have a profound leukocytosis of twenty to twenty two during much of her hospital course as the steroids were tapered to off her white blood cell count on was fifteen zerozerozero it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe pneumonia 
for the left lower lobe pneumonia the patient had initially received a course of levofloxacin five hundred po qd from to this was restarted on for an additional seven day course given the fact that she still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the left lower lobe 
hypothyroidism the patient was continued on outpatient medical regimen 
depression the patient was continued on lexapro per outpatient regimen it is recommended that she follow up with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital course and did appear clinically to be depressed 
prophylaxis she was maintained on proton pump inhibitor with subq heparin 
sore throat the patient did have a sore throat for much of the hospital course post extubation this was treated with cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid a solution containing kaopectate bismuth and lidocaine at bedtime 
communicationcode status the patient was full code throughout her hospital course and communication was maintained with the patient and her husband 
muscle weakness the patient did have profound muscle weakness and was evaluated by physical therapy and was found to have impaired functional mobility impaired musculoskeletal performance impaired gas exchange impaired endurance impaired ventilation and needed help with supine to sit however she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair for approximately one hour 
on motor exam her flexors and extensors of the lower extremities were at the knee at the ankle at the elbows and hips it was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a prolonged hospital course 
speechswallow the patient had a speech and swallow evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia no evidence of vocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement discharge condition the patient was able to oxygenate on room air at ninety three percent at the time of discharge she was profoundly weak but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood pressure her respirations were much improved albeit with transmitted upper airway sounds

one presumed cdiff infxn admitted and started on po vancomyin and iv metronidazole w addition of levofloxacin for broad spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery cholestyramine was initially given for toxin binding wbc was thirty on admission and trended down with abx however cdiff toxin neg x five so diagnosis remains presumptive c diff b toxin was sent and was negative as well she completed a three week course of po vanco and iv flagyl antibiotics which was completed on she subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea and was able to tolerate po s 
two pt began having episodes of brbpr on with resultant slow hct drop gi and surgery were consulted pt had no abdominal pain but given recent surgery and low albumin we were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel or dehiscence pt was also having intermittent episodes of tachycardia raising the possibility that she was having embolic phenomena with acute ischemia however she had no abdominal pain to suggest this colonoscopy was done on showing severe c dif vs ischemic bowel surgery found that pt was not surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage was c dif and would continue to improve biopsy results showed no evidence of cdif but given pt s tenuous status po vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin b it is quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were the result of c dif infxn which had been treated wabx and resolved leaving the mucosae to heal as well gi felt there may be a superimposed ischemic insult no further work up was performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis following completion of cdiff treatment 
two acute renal failure w cri renal team was consulted on admisison baseline cr is approx two point zero on admission this was significantly elevated to four point one fena was cw prerenal etiology and patient had r ij placed in ed started on ns for volume resusciation this was undertaken slowly given that pt had an albumin of one point four and pleural effusions were noted on ct fluids were changed to one two ns w bicarb on hd two cr trended down each day and the patient has maintained oxygenation albcr ratio not cw nephrotic range proteinuria thus it was felt that the low alb was likely multifactorial pt initially required boluses of five hundred cc ns to maintain uop twenty thirty cchr with hydration and improvement in her diarrhea her cr steadily decreased and returned to baseline of one point six she was seen by renal who felt that her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to atnhypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive overdiuresis she did subsequently require aggressive diuresis given her rapid afibchf with lasix and niseritide drips however her creatinine remained at baseline of one point seven two point zero with diuresis she did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis which was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis therefore her lasix was weaned to fourty mg daily and her bicarb trended back down to thirty her creatinine was stable at one point six at the time of discharge 
three pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic on admisison unclear why it was low when patient presented most likely extreme inflammatorysirs response given elev lactate on admission her plt count dropped to ninety five and dic workup and hit ab were sent both negative her plt count rose as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range for the duration of her hosital course 
four htn pt s baseline sbp is in the one hundred eighty s two hundred s range on admission bp was low three rd spacing and early sepsis her bp responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive she was continued on metoprolol for hrbp control and isordilhydral was added for afterload reduction 
five chf evidence of chf on initial cxr her ef was found to be fourty percent previously normal bringing up concern for ischemic event precipitating her failure in support of this she was noted to have wall motion abnormalities on echo with inferoseptalbasal hypokinesis diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to her renal insufficiency and decompensated chf she was managed medically and on the chf service was consulted for management she was initiated on aggressive diuresis with iv lasix for goal one point five l per day she was transferred to the ccu briefly on for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her chf lasix boluses and nesiritide with good effect negative approximately five hundred cc overnight she was transferred back to the floor on lasix boluses 
due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given one hundred sixty mg iv started on lasix drip at ten mghr then started nesiritide one mcgkg followed by gtt at zero point zero one mcgkgmin diuresed well to this and maintained bp well however after increasing natrecor to zero point zero fifteen went back into rapid afib stopped natrecor on stopped lasix gtt on given persistent good diuresis now tapered down to fourty mg daily lasixday afterload reduction w isordilhydral on at the time of discharge she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching ins and outs daily we will continue her on this regimen upon discharge 
atrial fibrillation initially converted from raf by medical cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the ccu at thirteen mgkghr x ten min load followed by two mghr for two h trial became hypotensive to sixty s systolic but subsequently recovered then again went into raf on early am initially hr controlled w iv lopressoriv dilt then medical cardioversion w procainamide became hypotensive to seventy s systolic after about ten minutes on procainamide this was stopped and her blood pressures normalized she then converted ten min later to nsr she has been in nsr the remainder of her hospital course she is not on coumadin due to risk for bleed in addition amiodorone was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control however given the side effect profile the family and patient were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at this time they understand that there is a higher risk of conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for stroke without amiodorone we will continue rate control with metoprolol as mentioned at twenty five mg tid and may titrate up as needed to maintain hr eighty 
cad wall motion abnormalities on echo w inferoseptalbasal hk currently chest pain free continuing with medical management on statinb blocker no plan for cath at this time given her renal insuffco morbiditites also holding off on aspirin currently given her bleed risk this will be re addressed as an outpatient through her pcp 
anemia initially had episode of gi bleed with blood loss anemia requiring three units of packed red blood cells hematocrit subsequently normalized however she subsequently was noted to have a low but stable hematocrit at twenty eight twenty nine repeat stool guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of bleed or hemolysis iron stores were also found to be within normal limits with low tibc and high ferritin suggesting anemia of chronic disease this was felt likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency she was started on epo two zerozerozero units q m w fr on the goal transfusion criteria would be thirty given her history of cad however we have held off on further transfusion at this time given her known chf with recent severe volume overload we have set transfusion goal at hct twenty eight and transfused with one unit packed red blood cells and twenty mg iv lasix for hct twenty eight 
tachypnea resolved her transient tachypnea was felt likely secondary to volume overload there was no evidence of infiltrate by cxr her abg at the time on showed seven point twenty nine fourty three ninety nine her respiratory status subsequently improved that same day on following iv lasix and atrovent nebulizers avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia

hospital course the patient was taken to the operating room for wound exploration directly from the trauma room the patient was taken to the operating room as mentioned above for an exploratory laparotomy extensive lysis of adhesions and control of rectus and omental bleeding the estimated blood loss was approximately one zerozerozero cc please see the operative note dictated by dr on for complete report 
the patient was then transferred to the sicu where his coagulopathy was corrected he received four units of packed red cells four units of ffp and one cryoprecipitate 
while on the unit he was extubated on sicu day number three and he was noted to have progressive thrombocytopenia his home po medications were restarted as well 
on hospital day number four the patient was transferred to the floor his diet was advanced and he was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to get his bowels moving postsurgically the pain service was also consulted because of the patient s history of narcotic abuse and his continued complaints of pain they recommended increasing his dose of klonopin and starting msir 
on hospital day number five the patient was noted to have a heparin induced antibody which may be one of the reasons he was coagulopathic on admission although his hiv disease and other drug abuse cannot be ruled out as cause his platelet count remained relatively stable however as did his hematocrit 
by hospital day number six the patient was doing somewhat better however after being noted to be somewhat sedated his klonopin dose as well as msir and methadone were decreased the patient did work with physical therapy and was able to ambulate hop a bit out of bed 
additionally case management spoke with the patient s long term nurse practitioner who stated that at baseline he normally uses a wheelchair and occasionally walks on his prosthesis additionally the nurse practitioner stated that the patient does chronically abuse drugs both prescriptions and illicits and advised not to give the patient any pain prescriptions upon discharge as he had more than enough at home it was also discussed that the patient would often try to prolong his hospital courses in the past in an attempt to get more narcotics 
on the date of discharge the patient will be set up with vna services for home to change his dressings he will also be instructed to follow up with his primary care doctor or trauma clinic to have the staples removed from his abdominal wound 
condition on discharge stable 
discharge status discharged to home with services

knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and degenerative changes with small right knee effusion 
hospital course one altered mental status this was felt to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain the patient was evaluated by radiationoncology and it was decided that the patient would receive a total of seven treatments of whole brain radiation therapy 
additionally she was maintained on decadron as well as dilantin the patient had no seizure activity while in the hospital she tolerated her decadron well and tolerated her whole brain radiation therapy without any complications 
the patient was discharged on a decadron taper her dilantin dose was increased to a total of three hundred three times a day given that her dilantin level id was only eight the patient will need her dilantin level followed as an outpatient at her next appointment

active issues 
acute on chronic systolic heart failure the patient was hypervolemic on exam with elevated jvp and increased abdominal distension at presentation given the patient had been refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on admission ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic therapy she experienced significant muscle cramping and hypotension while on cvvhd requiring dopamine cvvhd was discontinued on hd two and she was diuresed with iv lasix and metolazone pressures improved and she was weaned off of dopamine it was noted that urine and blood pressure improved when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with asynchronous ventricular pacing therefore the patients pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native rhythm and the mode was changed to aair despite this change urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis on hd six patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter and on hd seven she continued hd using the tunneled line see below lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient will be hd dependent

brief hospital course f with nodular sclerosing hodgkin s lymphoma initially admitted for urosepsis and who was transferred to the icu with hypotension and afib with rvr 
goals of care the patient had a long hospital course with many family meetings reagarding goals of care on the patient was made dnrdni but the family continued to want icu transfers and pressors if needed regardless of comfort to the patient the patient was tranferred to the unit on she was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care care was not escalated and she expired at on the family declined autopsy 
afib with rvr pt experienced transient episodes of afib to one hundred fifty s controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol with spontaneous conversion but with multiple episodes of up to four second pauses and bradycardia to fourty likely junctional escape digoxin considered unfavorable in this patient in the micu pt was started on amiodarone gtt and converted to amiodarone po when the patient was readmitted to the icu on she was having increased pauses up to twenty seconds her amiodarone was stopped 
thrombocytopeniaanemia the patient was anemia and thrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be secondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma was transfused total of three units plt one unit each on and with a transfusion threshold of ten will continue to trend platelets transfuse for bleeding or platelet count ten transfused one unit platelets with good bump on also the patient has been receiving prbc transfusions for hct twenty four total of four units since 
hypotension early on in the admission she was having hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to fluid blosues of two hundred fifty cc echo demonstrated impaired lv relaxation and given elevated wbc there was concern for distributive shock once no longer fluid responsive she was started on phenylephrine gtt which was weaned off she was again hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary to systemic vasodilation she was started on levophed but a decision was then made to not escalate care 
infection wbc elevated with multiple possible infectious sources which could contribute to hypotension ie skin erosions under breasts course breath sounds with pna vanc and piptaz started on cultures of blood and urine pending sputum not obtainable at this point cdiff repeated with toxin b c diff neg thus dc flagyl now with gnr from skin swab 
hypernatremia noted to be periodically hypernatremic since admission na one hundred fourty eight one hundred fifty due to free water defecit she has been getting slow infusions of d five w as she has poor po intake and have not been able to keep up her free water intake 
altered mental status increased lethargy compared to baseline on admission most likely metabolic encephalopathy due to infection and acute renal failure with slight improvement after resolution of urosepsis head ct negative for acute process thyroid studies show elevated tsh but this may be cw sick euthyroid syndrome 
respiratory distress early in her admission the patient developed labored breathing after receiving one l ns for hypotension cw flash pulmonary edema diuresis with furosemide gtt lead to hypotension albumin resuscitation lead to repeated respiratory distress on she was on the floor and had a witnessed aspiration event and needed one hundred percent hi flow mask while in the icu her o two was weaned but again aspirated and had increasing o two requirements 
acute renal failure pt noted to have cr up to one point seven on admission from presumed baseline of one point zero returned to baseline of zero point nine likely was pre renal due to dehydration and hypotension due to sepsis later in her hospital course the patient was hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought secondary to atn 
hypothyroidism initially treated with levothyroxine twelve point five mcg iv daily half home dose t three low tsh elevated resumed home dose one four 
anasarca pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural effusions likely third spacing from malnutrition given low albumin two point eight on admission then two point two and poor po intake diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed above continue to monitor 
urosepsis admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis requiring pressor support urine cultures from were positive for ecoli and pt completed treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime x ten days repeat ucx grew out yeast which was not treated another repeat ucx final again grew out yeast 
right hip pain pain due to destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on ct scan there is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head secondary to lack of remaining osseous support stable destruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and surrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone the patient s pain is being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches 
bilateral pleural effusion rl thought most likely due to agressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and hypoalbuminemia was difficult to effect a significant diurese in micu due to development of hypotension in response to furosemide appears slightly improved on cxr from unchanged on cxr 
nodular sclerosing hodgkin s lymphoma seen by oncology no interventions at this time likely with bone marrow infiltration causing anemia and thrombocytopenia above as pt with low retic count and no evidence of hemolysis no further treatment per oncology

pertinent results studies cxr impression moderate congestive heart failure worse since the exam of one month ago 
echo tte conclusions the left atrium is moderately dilated there is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy overall left ventricular systolic function is normal lvef sixty percent 
there is mild aortic valve stenosis area one point two one point nine cm two moderate two aortic regurgitation is seen 
there is severe mitral annular calcification there is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral stenosis mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is seen [due to acoustic shadowing the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly underestimated] 
the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened the supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickenedfibrotic 
there is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension there is a small pericardial effusion 
compared with the findings of the prior study images reviewed of borderline mitral stenosis is now evident the mitral regurgitation which is almost certainly underestimated on this study is probably increased 
cxr two views comparison with the previous study done there is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema the mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists streaky density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental atelectasis there is a moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion an underlying right basilar consolidation cannot be excluded the heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged

hypertensive emergency her htn is likely secondary to her esrd the elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure she was given blood pressure medications to help control her bp within the range of one hundred thirty one hundred sixty as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion her baseline bp is reportedly one hundred sixty at home ultimately she was placed on clonidine zero point two mg tid hydralazine one hundred mg tid norvasc ten mg qday metoprolol twelve point five mg tid lasix fourty mg 
svt during her initally presentation she did have some runs of svt noted on telemetry once she was diuresed no further episodes were noted she was continued on metoprolol twelve point five mg tid for given episodes of svt 
congestive heart failure likely from worsening renal failure and hypertensive urgency she was agressively diuresed in the micu with iv furosemide overnight and then with po furosemide on the medical floor she was also continued on hydralazine for afterload reduction 
renal failure a renal consult was obtained they felt that there was no acute needs for dialysis at present although they have been discussing starting hd with the patient and her family for a while now this discussion was continued throughout the admission and the patient and her family were resistent to starting they agreed to meet with dr in the next two weeks to discuss getting a tunnelled cath and starting hd throughout admission her electrolytes were monitored closely as she had boughts of hyperkalemia hyperphosphatemia and acidosis these were controlled with standard measures

brief hospital course 
dyspnea her shortness of breath and respiratory failure were thought secondary to pulmonary edema the pulmonary edema likely followed an indolent course with her rapid atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction causing progressive volume overload her acute exacerbation was likely due to post cardioversion pulmonary edema she initially had a low grade fever but pneumonia was thought less likely and her chest x ray was without infiltrate she had normal cardiac enzymes so ischemia was not a contributing factor she was maintained on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor after aggressive diuresis she was weaned off mechanical ventilation quickly diuresis was continued with prn iv lasix and she had resolution of her dyspnea and oxygen requirement 
atrial fibrillation she was in sinus rhythm on admission and was initially maintained on propafenone and metoprolol on she converted to atrial fibrillation and had a rapid ventricular response in the one hundred fourty s she underwent dc cardioversion after which she became hypotensive and bradycardic requiring transient treatment with dopamine she was continued on propafenone after the dccv on the morning of she converted into atrial fibrillation again with rates of one hundred fourty s she had a normal blood pressure and some mild palpitations she was initially loaded with po amiodarone with slowing of her heart rates to the one hundred s to one hundred ten s when her heart rate began to trend up again she was loaded with iv amiodarone and started on a drip her rates remained in the one hundred s to one hundred ten s she was transitioned to po amiodarone on the night of she experienced nausea and vomiting on po amiodarone she underwent another cardioversion on but reverted back to atrial fibrillation the next day she was continued on amiodarone but remained in atrial fibrillation she went into rapid ventricular response in the one hundred fifty s on requiring iv diltiazem to bring her rate down she was started on po diltiazem which was quickly titrated up with her heart rate decreasing to the eighty s the diltiazem was stopped the morning of just before she underwent another cardioversion she remained in sinus rhythm for the rest of her stay she was discharged on amiodarone two hundred mg po three times daily with a follow up appointment with dr anticoagulation as below

brief hospital course summary briefly this is a eighty one year old russian speaking woman who presented status post fall no intracranial bleed no hip fracture r humerus fracture ct of c spine showed severe stenosis she was initially admitted to the medicine service for workup of syncope neurology was consulted for a weak right arm following r humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed central cord and brown sequard syndrome and transferred to the neurology service for closer exam monitoring she underwent r humerus orif and c two c six laminectomy and fusion on a med consult was obtained on for persistent hypoxia she was gently diuresed and had serial abg s which showed persistent hypercarbia during the admission she was also treated with cipro for a uti 
neuro the patient could not recall the events surrounding the fall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal humerus displaced and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness distally in all four extremities on exam she initially was found to have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness affecting arms more so than legs she also had evidence of a brown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on the right with an upgoing toe and pin sensation is down on the left sensory level of c four t three anteriorly on the left where the two dermatomes meet at the top of the breast she was complaining of neck pain and had had trouble voiding so a foley was placed 
mri of the c spine was performed for the likelihood of acute spinal cord injury with above findings read of mri was bulky ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at c two three c three four and c four five levels more than the right causing severe spinal canal stenosisthe cervical cord at those levels is deformed and compressed demonstrating intrinsic t two hyperintense signal there is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of c three anteriorly she was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain was controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially she was seen by both neurosurgery and orthopedics for the injury as both services had been alternately covering the spine service in the hospital orthopedics also followed her for the broken right humerus and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ed when a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma later proven to be artifactual 
both and neurosurgery agreed that it was safest for the patient to hold off on the spine surgery for at least a week to allow cord swelling to heal before operating she remained in a hard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next week the pinprick sensory level retracted to the t twelve region for days then finally seemed to vanish altogether the proprioceptive changes on the right also resolved although the right arm remained weak and flaccid with just finger flexors and trapeziusshoulder shrug initially thought just limited by pain versus multiple nerve injury the left arm strength improved to deltoid tri both four to five five and wrist and finger extensors four five finger flexors were also four five on there were no changes in exam for neuropathic pain neurontin had been initiated patient later requested dc to simplify med regimen 
the weekend of on morning rounds a mild right horner s syndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily rounds this along with the flaccid arm was suggestive of root avulsion on the right and associated plexopathy her neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during hospitalization 
pt underwent r humerus orif and cervical laminectomy report below however pt post op the medicine service was consulted for hypoxia pt required fifty percent shovel mask and hypercarbia pco two in high fifty s she has a follow up appointment on with to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her c collar can be removed 
hypoxiahypercarbia pt had hx of severe pulm htm likely pda abg showed mild co two retention if this was close to her baseline also likely had component of fluid overload given recent surgery pt was gently diuresed with iv lasix narcotics were dc d as pt appeared somnolent o two was successfully weaned down to two l nc pt apparently had been on two l o two at home cta on admission was negative for pe and the suspicion for pe was fairly low post op given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement improved therefore repeat cta was not done she was also noted to be hypercarbic during admission but her respiratory status remained stable while on the medicine service 
status post fall the original fall was of unclear etiology the differential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset afibatach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness less likely include myocardial infarctionischemia versus pulmonary embolism versus seizure also less likely hypoglycemia given timing after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally cleared in setting of increased creatinine the patient ruled out for mi by cardiac enzymes echo showed no obvious severe valvular disease to explain syncopal event though telemetry showed periodic tachyarrhythmia sinus tach vs afib she had no other significant tele events while in the hospital 
elevated wbc and lactate at admission unclear etiology afebrile with negative ua and infectious workup at admission this cleared on its own later in hospitalization she had a uti treated with course of ciprofloxacin urine cxlood cx and cath tip cx were sent prior to dc to workup somnolence however pt s somnolence cleared and cx s were pending on dc these should be followed at her follow up appointments 
musculoskeletal initially radiographic imaging was negative for fracture or bleed including right ue hips bilaterally c spine and head patient with known chronic low back pain and sciatica

hypercholesterolemia continued home dose of lipitor

indications for procedure ms is an eighty one year old woman who sustained a fall and has a displaced right proximal humerus fracture she also has a spine injury and this has been operated on by dr given the displacement of her fracture and that she is having pain and not tolerating nonoperative treatment we decided to proceed with intramedullary nailing 
description of procedure after informed consent was obtained and dr had completed his spinal portion of the case the patient was placed in the supine position the right arm was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion 
a three cm incision was made over the proximal humerus and the deltoid was split eentry point was established in the proximal humerus and the guide wire placed the fracture was held reduced and the guide wire passed into the distal humerus the proximal part of the humerus was reamed and then the canal was reamed up to a size ten mm next a two hundred thirty by ten mm and nephew nail was placed and interlocked with two screws proximally the distal locking screw was placed under image intensification wounds were irrigated and closed with zero vicryl two zero and a subcuticular three zero postoperatively she was brought back to the recovery room in stable condition

brief hospital course the patient was initially taken emergently to the operating room for exploratory laparascopy with general surgery back up she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics they observed a normal left tube and and copius greenish yellow fluid as well as right lower quadrant adhesions and a diffusely inflammed small intestine the general surgery team became infvolved and noted that the appendix was acutely inflamed but there was no other pathology after completion of the exploratory laparatomy the patient remained tachycardic with otherwise stable vital signs but required fifteen l of resucitation despite this the patients hematocrit rose from fourty one point three to fifty two and her wbc rose form twelve point nine to thirty nine point seven the patients urine output also began to decrease the patient was becoming edematous and the patient had increased respiratory distress it was believed that the patient was third spacing and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring 
on post op day two the patient was taken back for a reexploration given that the patient had the hemodynamics above and the patients abdominal exam worsened in the operating room they discovered a retroperitoneum that was diffulsely petichial and ecchymotic with significant retroperitoneal edema and bowel edema the appendages eppiplocae were hemorrhagic there was pathc purpuring darkening concerning for ischemia of the cecum the patient underwent a right colectomy with an ileosotomy and right transverse colon mucous fistula the patient could not be closed and the abdomen was left open the patient was sent back to the intensive care unit intubated the infectious disease and rheumatology services were consulted and were intimately involved and the results of the studies they suggested are listed above 
the patients hemodynamic status improved although the patient remained tachycardic and intermittently febrile although cultures remained negative and the patient remained on broad spectrum antibiotics she continued to recieve fluid boluses for decreased urine output on post operative days three and one tpn was started on post operative days four and two on post operative days five and three the patient had an echocardiogram to rule out an embolic source for possible mesenteric ischemia and a hit panel was sent for decreased platelets on post operative days six and four the patient was brought back to the operating room for closure of her abdomen a vent wean was started on post operative days seven five and one and continued until postoperative days ten eight four when she was successfully extubated her ng tube was also discontinued she was transferred to the floor and on postoperative days twelve ten six the patient was started on sips she was seen by physical therapy as well as continued on her tpn her tpn was discontinued on the following day while the patient started taking clears the patient was also seen by enterostomy therapy to help in teaching she remained hemodynamically stable was passing stool through her ostomy bag had a well healing incision and was tolerating a regular diet and was ready for discharge on post operative day fourteen twelve eight with a one week course of cipro flagyl to be completed per the infectious disease team

hospital course by system 
cardiac a ischemia as above patient with proximal left anterior descending stent in stent re stenosis as well as significant occlusion to the ramus intermedius status post intervention the patient was started on aspirin and plavix post intervention peak ck was noted to be seventy one to eighty five which was on which gradually trended down to a value of one hundred thirteen on the day of admission in addition the patient was started on an ace inhibitor and beta blocker once blood pressure could tolerate

c rhythm patient noted to have a sinus tachycardia on arrival to the coronary care unit on a dopamine drip subsequently was switched to milrinone and levophed drips the patient s sinus tachycardia improved to normal sinus rhythm with occasional episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which was thought secondary to reperfusion 
pulmonary patient noted to be hypercarbia and hypoxic in the catheterization laboratory on a non rebreather and decision for intubation was made the patient was maintained on assist control on arrival to the coronary care unit and subsequently was weaned with successful extubation on hospital day number three 
hematology patient with a history of chronic anemia secondary to chronic autoimmune hemolytic etiology maintained on prednisone as an outpatient in light of recent events the patient was placed on stress dose steroids through the intravenous which was subsequently changed to oral prednisone the patient received two to three units of packed red blood cells while in the coronary care unit secondary to a slightly decreased hematocrit which was thought secondary to her underlying chronic condition as well as possibly secondary to her gastrointestinal bleed in light of some coffee ground emesis the patient s hematocrit remained relatively stable during her hospital stay with a range of twenty eight to thirty three 
gastrointestinal as above patient with a history of a gastrointestinal bleed with one to two episodes of coffee ground emesis while in the coronary care unit coffee grounds then cleared and the patient was maintained on protonix fourty mg intravenously twice a day as above the patient s hematocrit remained stable for the most part during her hospital stay and she remained hemodynamically stable and there was no need for gastroenterology consult during this hospital stay

additional hospital course the patient was transferred from the coronary care unit to the floor at approximately three am on without event at approximately nine am the patient began to complain of shortness of breath and was found to be tachycardic to the one hundred fifty s after walking a distance to the bathroom the patient s electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with st elevations in leads v two and v three otherwise the electrocardiogram was unchanged on examination the patient had a blood pressure of one hundred fourty six sixty pulse of one hundred thirty five pulse oxygenation ninety eight percent on two liters was diffusely wheezy on respiratory examination and was markedly diaphoretic without jugular venous distention or edema the patient was given several doses of intravenous lopressor as well as high dose intravenous lasix the pulse oxygenation transiently fell to eighty eight percent on five liters face mask and an arterial blood gas taken was seven point thirty seven thirty two fifty six a chest x ray demonstrated increased congestive heart failure and the patient was given some nitro paste without effect and then begun on nitroglycerin drip as well as additional lasix eighty mg intravenous push 
the patient rapidly thereafter clinically improved with a blood pressure falling from a high in the one hundred seventy s eighty s to one hundred thirty five seventy six with a normalization of respiratory rate and a pulse oxygenation of ninety two to ninety five percent on six liters as well as over a liter of urine out ultimately and a clearing of previous wheezing on examination 
the patient was again cycled with cardiac enzymes which revealed a troponin elevated greater than the measurable range likely from the prior cardiac events that were described in dr dictation however repeated measurements of creatine kinase failed to demonstrate an elevation in that enzyme and rather demonstrated a continued trend down the patient was begun on standing lasix initially at fourty mg once daily which was then increased to fourty mg twice a day and then to eighty mg by mouth twice a day the thought being that the patient had been approximately four liters positive during this admission and that the above described events likely represented worsening congestive heart failurepulmonary edema in the setting of volume overload additionally the patient s blood pressure was better controlled with captopril twelve point five mg by mouth three times a day and the patient s lopressor dose as well was increased to fifty mg by mouth three times a day with good effect on the patient s cardiac rate 
the patient s hematocrit continued to be stable for the remainder of this admission she had no further respiratory difficulties and was seen by physical therapy who suggested inpatient therapy to improve the patient s endurance 
the patient was sent for echocardiography which demonstrated an ejection fraction between twenty and twenty five percent with multiple wall motion abnormalities as described in discussion with the cardiology team the decision was made not to anticoagulate the patient at this time given her recent history of significant clinical gastrointestinal bleeding in consultation with the patient s attending cardiologist decision was made to discharge the patient to rehabilitation on 
please note that during the sequence described for the patient s electrocardiogram appeared to show sinus tachycardia with the above stated st elevations in v two and v three which did resolve with the patient s tachycardia 
additional data the patient was sent for echocardiography on with the following findings symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with extensive regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease pulmonary artery systolic hypertension moderate mitral regurgitation mild aortic regurgitation the left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be between twenty and twenty five percent left ventricular wall motion was noted in detailed report to have abnormalities in the basal anterior portion which was hypokinetic mild mid anterior which was akinetic basilar and anteroseptal which was akinetic mid anteroseptal which was akinetic basal inferoseptal which was hypokinetic mid inferoseptal which was hypokinetic anterior apex which was akinetic septal apex which was akinetic inferior apex which was akinetic lateral apex which was akinetic and apex which was dyskinetic

assessment this was an eighty three year old woman with known congestive heart failure and ischemic coronary disease presenting flash pulmonary edema in the setting of blood transfusion 
hospital course one cardiovascularischemia the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization while intubated the catheterization showed instant restenosis of her left anterior descending stent at fourty percent however distal to the stent there was an eighty percent focal lesion which was ballooned and stented her ramus stent were patent with associated ostial fourty percent lesion her known eighty percent right coronary artery lesion remained unchanged right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary wedge pressure of thirty ra pressure of twelve pa pressure of sixty one thirty four rv pressure of sixty one sixteen cardiac output was four point four with an index of two point nine mixed venous saturation in the catheterization lab was fifty seven point six from the pulmonary artery 
the patient did well postcatheterization and was able to be extubated she was placed on aspirin and plavix for life beta blocker was re added and lopressor was titrated up fifty mg bid ace inhibitor was also added her statin was continued as well she remained chest pain free and free of shortness of breath throughout the rest of her hospitalization 
cardiovascularpump the patient s ejection fraction was known to be twenty percent heart catheterization confirmed her fluid overload and congestive heart failure physiology she did not respond to lasix on initially arriving in the ccu however after catheterization she diuresed well to lasix with general improvement in her pa diastolics and improvement of her kidney function she was able to be extubated without difficulty after adequate diuresis was achieved 
upon arrival to the floor from the ccu the chf service was consulted they recommended initiating digoxin low dose nitrate and standing po lasix which was done she was discharged with plans to follow up with the chf service for continued medical management of her congestive heart failure 
pulmonary the patient was able to be initially extubated on the second hospital day however on the day after initial extubation her status remained tenuous with increasing nitroglycerin drip and prn morphine required to reduce her preload enough to maintain oxygenation on the night after initial extubation she required emergent reintubation due to acute hypoxia chest x ray prior to intubation demonstrated white out of the lower two thirds of the right lung however film three four hours postintubation showed resolution of the opacity throughout the right lung consistent with acute mucous plugging it was therefore thought that that episode of hypoxia was not due to congestive heart failure but to mucous plugging the patient was reextubated without difficulty status post catheterization and maintained satisfactory oxygenation throughout the remainder of her hospital stay 
she was also started on levofloxacin on admission due to suspicion of right upper lobe infiltrate levofloxacin was switched to ceftriaxone and azithromycin on the third hospital day she remained afebrile throughout her hospital course but did however start to develop a cough toward the end of her hospital stay she was continued on the ceftriaxone through the hospital stay with the plan for a total fourteen day course along with her azithromycin 
infectious disease as above the patient was treated for suspicion of pneumonia of note she had an isolated positive blood culture growing gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters from however she was afebrile throughout the time surrounding this culture repeat cultures were drawn on and were pending at the time of this dictation 
heme the patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia with a baseline hematocrit in the mid twenty s as noted in the hpi she was transfused one u prior to her episode of flash pulmonary edema hematology service was and they felt that it would be acceptable to transfuse the patient as needed the patient was transfused with one additional unit of blood during her hospital stay due to her steroids and autoimmune hemolytic anemia she was restarted on stress dose steroids as she had been on her previous admission these were quickly tapered to a discharge dose of prednisone ten mg qd the patient had stable blood pressure and hematocrit on this dose 
fluids electrolytes and nutrition the patient developed hypernatremia toward the end of her hospital stay with a peak sodium of one hundred fifty one it was thought that this was due to inadequate po intake and free water intake and she was encouraged to maintain po intake a nutrition consult was obtained as well follow up labs of her sodium were pending at the time of this dictation

hypertensive emergency pt presented with htn systolics two hundred and blurry vision found to have papilledema the patient s blood pressure was markedly elevated with systolic blood pressures ranging from one hundred sixty two hundred ten during icu stay review of prior notes outlines a longstanding history of poorly controlled blood pressures his home isosorbide and carvedilol were discontinued labetalol was uptitrated to two hundred mg tid hydral downtitrated to fifty mg tid clonidine zero point three mg weekly patch started and furosemidemetolazone continued as is map one hundred twenty was goal on leaving the icu spb was in one hundred thirty s tsh was within normal limits it was felt that this patient needed a full workup for secondary causes of hypertension in the meantime renal artery ultrasound done here showed no renal artery stenosis but did show chornic bilateral changes consistent with ckdd he should likely have a workup for hyperaldosteronism see hypokalemia below and workup including urine metanephrines and dexamethasone suppression test as he is quite young for this degree of hypertension and seems to be compliant with his medications he was initially started on spironolactone given report of ef twenty five thirty percent and thought that it may help with hypokalemia however after three days three doses this was discontinued so that pt could ideally have a reninaldosterone level drawn prior to discharge which is now pending several days after discontinuation would recommend restarting this medication after the appropriate studies have been done it is more than likely this patient has sleep apnea as well in the icu he was noted to have desats during sleep with very loud snoring desats resolved instantly on waking pt is also smoking and quite obese both of which are likely worsening his hypertension would recommend outpatient sleep study as well

discharge condition mental status clear and coherent level of consciousness alert and interactive activity status ambulatory requires assistance or aid walker or cane 
discharge instructions you were admitted to the hospital after being struck by a motor vehicle as a result of this accident you sustained multiple injuries as listed below 
your multiple rib fractures can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain 
you should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won t be able to take deep breaths if the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician 
pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures in order to decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer four times every hour while awake this will help expand the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that pool in the lungs 
you will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing 
symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain 
narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible 
do not smoke 
if your doctor allows non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs are very effective in controlling pain ie ibuprofen motrin advil aleve naprosyn but they have their own set of side effects so make sure your doctor approves 
return to the emergency room right away for any acute shortness of breath increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs crepitus

brief hospital course ms is a sixty one yo w stage ii breast cancer who was admitted on day thirteen or cycle two of docetaxel taxotere cyclophosphomide who developed fever to one hundred point six at home with associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia 
neutropenic fever on presentation the pt s pmn count was twenty one most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of neulasta use two possible sources of infection existed including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered while gardening she was broadly covered with vancomycin and cefepime to cover both possible sources as well as flagyl to cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased ostomy output when cdiff returned negative flagyl was discontinued blood cultures were sent and a ua was not concerning for infection we also sent off galactomannan antigen and beta d glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic fever workup which were negative the following day after admission her wbc rose significantly and she no longer was neutropenic as her wbc rose she started to develope a cough and he cxr became concerning for an infiltrate she was continued on vanccefepime until afebrile and with anc one thousand for greater than fourty eight hours after which she was switched to po levofloxacin to complete an eight day total course for community acquired pneumonia 
hypotension in the pt s sbp dropped to seventy s not responding to ivf boluses she refused central line placement in the ed and peripheral pressors were initiated this is most likely related to her underlying infectious process she was not administered any medications recently that could be accounting for her hypotension looking through omr her baseline blood pressures are sbp of ninety s one hundred s an a line was obtained which showed higher bp than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff she was given several liters of iv fluid boluses and weaned off pressors the night of admission to the icu her cuff and a line pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a line was discontinued 
breast cancer currently in cycle two of docetaxel taxotere cyclophosphomide most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt s request however due to the rapid rise in her wbc count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility

eeg this is an abnormal portable eeg obtained in stage ii sleep with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent and independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both sides this finding suggests deep midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis in addition exessive drowsiness was seen perhaps also related to the underlying infection

gbs meningitisbactermia in the unit the pt was continued on ampicillin and started on gentamicin for synergy her intrathecal baclofen pump was thought to be infected on exam erythema and warmth overlying pump in ruq pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the operation appeared to be without complication the following day pt had eleven point hematocrit drop and was noted to be hypotensive with an sbp of seventy after spiking a temp it was thought that she might be septic she was given fluids prbcs ffp and placed on levophed abd ct demonstrated a seven x thirteen x eleven cm hematoma in the ruq at the former pump site pt was taken emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated slow ooze noted and the bleeding vessel cauterized she returned to the floor and remained hemodynamically stable given one additional unit of prbcs her hct bumped appropriately and remained in the high twenty s for the rest of her unit course pt developed erythematous macular rash on face arms knees thought to be to pcn allergy amp was dc d and replaced briefly with vanc and then changed permanently to cefrtriaxone repeat lp was performed since the pt continued to be minimially responsive withdrawing to pain occ opening eyes to name csf analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis prior to leaving the unit pt spiked a temp to one hundred one point two she was pancultured and all cultures were negative a tte ruled out endocarditis in the setting of group b strep bacteremia on day twelve of gentamycin pt was changed to vancceftaz for the completion of her treatment course 
ruq hematoma as above after the removal of the baclofen pump pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to be bleeding into the ruq pocket she was taken to the or for emergent evacuation of the hematoma on pod sixteen pt was noted to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her ruq neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the ruq hematoma but found a new fluid collection surgery was consulted and they diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given that it had no signs of infection 
pneumonia towards the end of the pt s icu stay she was evaluated by speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the passy muir valve she underwent bronchoscopy and bal was sent for culture the culture returned positive for mrsa and gram negative rods not pseudomonas she was started on vancomycin for mrsa and ceftazlevaquin for double coverage of the gnr once the gnr sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas ceftaz was stopped of note pt had vancomycin troughs that were persistently high vancomycin troughs should be checked often and vanc should be adjusted for a level fifteen after the pt s swallowing study she was noted to have increased secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was assumed that the pt aspirated that day she also spiked a temperature to one hundred so flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage vancomycin and levaquin will be finished on fourteen day course and flagyl s course will be complete on after ten days 
supraglottic edema as above pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she failed a passy muir valve on bronchoscopy it was noted that she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized she was taken to the or two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where her granulation tissue was debrided and a t tube was placed ent evaluated the patient and recommended a ct of the trachea to evaluate her anatomy the ct showed tracheal bronchomalacia and narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway ideally she will get surgery by ent to improve her subglottic edema when the patient has recovered from her acute illnesses 
anemia iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease pt s baseline hct is between twenty six and twenty nine and except for the hct drop after the bleed in the ruq pocket pt s hct remained stable

mental status at baseline although pt is significantly debilitated by ms she is alert oriented and conversant her decreased responsiveness was thought to be to meningitis but although pt seemed to have resolving temp and wbc with abx her diminished reponsiveness persisted repeat lp in the unit suggested a resolving meningitis neurology was following the pt and recommended an mri to rule out stroke esp given her of stroke at osh an mrv to rule out sinus thrombosis and an eeg to rule out subclinical seizures an eeg on hd three was consistent with severe encephalopathy and an eeg on hd six was consistent with meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures an mri was finally done on hd ten and showed mild communicating hydrocephalus no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and eventually returned to her baseline mental status pt s mental status remained at baseline and pt will follow up with neurology as an outpatient 
respiratory status after a supposed seizure at osh pt was mechanically ventilated thru her trach site bc no breath sounds were appreciated at baseline pt has respiratory weakeness two two to multiple sclerosis but does not require mechical ventilation trach in place to help with clearance of secretions pt placed on ac in unit then transferred to cpap and eventually placed on a trach mask with good results at time of discharge she was satting well on fourty percent trach mask

respiratory distress the patient was given lasix albuterol nebs and solu medrol in the emergency department and had rapid improvement of his symptoms it was thought that the patient s acute respiratory distress was most likely secondary to mucous plugging pe was ruled out by cta chest x ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure or pneumonia the patient also recently completed a steroid taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this admission he had no cough and no sputum production and no fevers the patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids as it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress and because it was unclear whether steroids was really benefitting this patient

hospital course in summary this is a sixty three year old male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and suctioning he was in his usual state of health until when he developed nausea lower abdominal pain projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis his hematocrit dropped from thirty one to a nadir of thirteen his gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the medical intensive care unit 
anemia secondary to acute blood loss the patient s gastrointestinal workup included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one without source of frank bleed however in light of his initial complaints of nausea abdominal pain and guaiac positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected physically the small bowel could be the source after stabilization in the medical intensive care unit with blood products fresh frozen plasma and platelets he was transferred to the medicine floor after having stable hematocrit for greater than twenty four hours while on the floor his hematocrit was checked initially every twelve hours after demonstrating stability for a total of seventy two hours it was spaced out to q day hematocrit checks all told the patient received seven units of packed red blood cells seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital stay on the patient underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples of the esophageal nodule not noted on previous study at the time of this dictation results of those biopsies were pending while in the medical intensive care unit the patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia he had a normal left ventricular hypertrophy haptoglobin and bilirubin on admission however making hemolysis a very unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of nineteen moreover no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his hospital course and were consistent with changes status post large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing hemolysis 
right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis on the patient began to complain of right upper extremity pain and swelling doppler ultrasound demonstrated an axillary deep vein thrombosis in light of his recent bleeding episode anticoagulation was held initially although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses there was still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of the patient s history of right pneumonectomy and the functionality of his one remaining lung the computerized tomography scan was performed to better examine the right upper extremity soft tissues in particular there was concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass lesion or fibrosis post his pneumonectomy that could be contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep vein thrombosis formation computerized tomographic venogram was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis however the patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in the setting of his acute bleed for only several days there was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses therefore an inferior vena cava filter was placed on the patient tolerated the procedure well on the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling of the right lower extremity examination was consistent with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity however as the patient already had an inferior vena cava filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all the decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging of the right lower extremity in light of his probable hypercoagulability decision was made to reinitiate anticoagulation with the coumadin his coumadin level will be followed by his outpatient physician his inr should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation facility and his coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a goal inr of two to three 
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaselung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy the patient was continued on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary toilet he was continued on his outpatient medicines combivent salmeterol and theophylline he was continued on antibiotic prophylaxis with bactrim double strength in light of his history of bronchiectasis he was monitored for acute decompensation and his respiratory status particularly concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis he continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint he was diuresed gently after arriving to the medicine floor status post fluid resuscitation and blood product administration in the medical intensive care unit in the setting of his acute bleed with the diuresis pulmonary toilet and supportive care his respiratory status improved somewhat however he is not back to his baseline of two liters of oxygen nasal cannula at home at the time of discharge he was maintaining saturations in the ninety seven to one hundred percent range on four liters but he continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and shortness of breath occasionally at rest it was felt that a lot the patient s dyspnea was secondary to muscle deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital stay therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status 
diabetes mellitus two the patient was maintained on a diabetic diet with qid fingersticks fingerstick blood glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding scale he was maintained on his outpatient dose of neurontin for neuropathy 
atrial fibrillation he was continued on his outpatient dose of amiodarone of note he is currently in sinus rhythm 
acute renal failure the patient on admission had an elevated creatinine level above his baseline this was likely secondary to prerenal causes specifically hypovolemia and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his acute bleeding episode his acute renal failure resolved after fluid hydration 
vitamin b twelve deficiency the patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of supplementation with vitamin b twelve one thousand mcg po bid 
hypercholesterolemia the patient was continued on his outpatient dose of lipitor ten mg po qd

hospital course this is a sixty three year old man with multiple medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on and represented with lower abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum and anemia 
gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia most likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and polypectomy patient had a negative egd and then had a colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of previous polypectomy this was clipped with two clips with good control of the bleeding 
patient s hematocrit remained stable he did receive a total of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission after colonoscopy with clipping no further melena or bright red blood per rectum was noted patient s hematocrits were followed serially and remained in the twenty six twenty seven range and eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to discharge but his hematocrit remained twenty nine and thirty one on day of discharge 
otherwise symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet which he tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright red blood per rectum 
patient was initially started on protonix fourty intravenously bid as his egd was negative eventually was switched back to his fourty po q day regimen which he continued even as an outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease 
patient s blood pressure remained stable after transfused with blood he also had a negative tagged red cell scan and negative egd eventually after colonoscopy had a small bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as in his previous admission this was also negative patient could not have a meckel scan during this stay because of barium and can have it at least one week after barium ingestion 
because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed patient s lovenox dose and coumadin dose were continued to be held patient s anticoagulation including aspirin coumadin and lovenox were to be held for at least one week and can be restarted on per gi 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient s respiratory status was stable and at baseline continued his home regimen of advair combivent and theophylline and prn nebulizers as needed although his pulmonary exam remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of two liters and will be discharged on the same regimen 
status post lung cancer status post pneumonectomy was stable with tracheostomy continued bid suctioning with good results continue the scopolamine patch for antiemetics 
prostate cancer he does have recently rising psa most recently eight point nine in zero two patient was eventually able to have a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative for metastases only positive for previous post surgical bony changes patient will be followed up with urologist dr in terms of his prostate cancer follow up 
troponin leak this was attributed to demand ischemia he had negative ekg changes and he had a catheterization in which revealed thirty percent mid lesion but no flow limiting disease his enzymes remained stable through the course of his stay and was attributed to his anemia patient s aspirin was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted patient was continued on his statin 
atrial fibrillation patient was in sinus rhythm throughout the course of his stay and was stable on amiodarone again his coumadin was held for concerns with bleeding 
deep venous thrombosispulmonary embolus he has a history of filter and right upper and right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis his hypercoagulable state is likely attributed to the prostate cancer but otherwise his coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons and patient did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper and right lower extremity 
patient was taken off his lasix dose through the course of the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability was given prn doses of lasix throughout the stay and continued to elevate his extremities with good results of them 
patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis the right lower extremity ultrasound was negative the right upper extremity did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but no progression or change from previous studies and this otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay 
diabetes he has fairly good control with hemoglobin a one c most recently at six point zero he was continued on his home regimen of glyburide once he was taking po and covered with sliding scale as needed for his neuropathy patient was continued on his tylenol number three and was discharged with a prescription for morphine sulfate per his request although he was not continued on this during the course of his stay

concise summary of hospital course by issuesystem 
pulmonary issues within the first few days of her admission the patient was treated with levofloxacin for a presumed community acquired pneumonia however despite antibiotic treatment the patient s white blood cell count remained elevated in the low twenty s it did trend down slightly during this time period 
throughout the first few days of her admission the patient denied any shortness of breath and had an oxygen saturation in the mid ninety s on room air 
on a posterioranterior and lateral chest x ray was obtained to re evaluate the patient s presumed pneumonia in comparison to the admission film the right lower lobe opacity had increased in size and intensity there was a probable right pleural effusion there was also slightly more prominent pulmonary vessels on the right which were considered to be positional the left lung was relatively clear at that time with minor atelectasis at the base 
the following day on a chest computed tomography was obtained to better visualize the patient s lungs this showed a right loculated pleural effusion with parietal pleural enhancement and several small gas reflections in addition there was right lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation and left upper lobe ground glass opacities consistent with a second infectious process 
at this time a pulmonary service consultation was obtained antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and ceftazidime the patient was taken to interventional pulmonary for placement of a chest tube on the right to drain the loculated effusion following placement of the chest tube the patient had a small amount of hemoptysis in interventional pulmonology in addition her oxygen saturation dropped to eighty eight percent on three liters via nasal cannula the patient was placed on one hundred percent nonrebreather with an increase in oxygen saturations to ninety six percent at that time the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further care 
in the intensive care unit the patient s oxygen requirement rapidly decreased however the chest tube did not drain the pleural fluid as expected it was found to not be in a sufficient pocket of pleural fluid cardiothoracic surgery was consulted but the patient and her family wished to avoid surgery at that time 
therefore on the patient was called out to the floor for further treatment with antibiotics her chest tube was removed the patient was treated broadly with ceftazidime vancomycin and metronidazole 
a long discussion was held with the patient and her family regarding the slim possibility of cure of her loculated infection with antibiotics alone however they continued to desire to avoid invasive procedures they were willing for a pigtail catheter to be placed in interventional radiology to see if it could drain some of her pleural effusion and this was done on fluid continued to drain from the pigtail catheter over the next several days during this time the patient s white blood cell count remained elevated but she was afebrile and had good oxygen saturations on room air 
however despite broad spectrum antibiotics and drainage from the pigtail catheter the patient s white blood cell count was still significantly elevated on at twenty two zerozerozero at that time the family spoke to the cardiac surgery and decided to proceed with a video assisted thoracic surgery the patient underwent the video assisted thoracic surgery procedure on following the procedure she was initially extubated however in the recovery unit the patient developed hypotension to a systolic blood pressure in the seventy s requiring treatment with neo synephrine acute respiratory distress with desaturations to the low ninety s on face mask and was eventually reintubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further management 
the patient was successfully extubated in the medical intensive care unit the next day on the patient was returned to the general medical floor later that day and has done well since that time at the time of this dictation the patient was saturating in the mid to high ninety s on room air in addition her white blood cell count continued to decrease following the video assisted thoracic surgery procedure on her white blood cell count was eleven point five her chest tube was removed on without difficulty 
an infectious and cytologic workup had been pursued on the fluid drained through the chest tube and pigtail catheter in addition specimens were sent during the video assisted thoracic surgery procedure at the time of this dictation the fluid obtained on grew scant gram positive rods all other cultures have been negative to date cytology specimens were negative for malignant cells final report of pleural tissue pathology was still pending 
neck pain issues a wide differential was considered on admission for the patient s right sided neck pain the patient had the neck pain only she was spiking fevers it was not reproducible on examination two days into the hospital course her neck pain resolved spontaneously and has not returned 
hypertension issues on admission the patient was continued on her home dose of lisinopril with good blood pressure control following the video assisted thoracic surgery procedure the patient became hypotensive in the recovery unit and required pressors however her blood pressure quickly returned to a normal range she was re initiated on lisinopril five mg by mouth once per day on 
depression issues the patient was continued on sertraline throughout her hospital course 
parkinson disease with body dementia issues this was stable throughout the hospital course the patient does not take any medications for this condition 
rehabilitation issues physical therapy worked with the patient as tolerated during her admission 
fluidselectrolytesnutrition issues the patient was maintained on a low sodium diet her potassium and magnesium were repleted as needed 
prophylaxis issues the patient was maintained on subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis pantoprazole for gastrointestinal prophylaxis senna and colace for a bowel regimen the patient was placed on a nicotine patch during her admission to avoid withdrawal given her long smoking history 
code status issues at this time the patient is do not resuscitatedo not intubate her family is very involved in the medical decision making

respiratory failure pulmonary dysfunctionreactive airway disease the most likely etiology of the precipitating event in this patient is a severe exaccerbation of her known reactive airway disease regarding precipitant the re introduction of mold is certainly intriguing and could also explain the cxr findings if it is felt that they represent an inflammatory response to some inhalation other more typical precipitants include a viral infection pneumonia pe see below and others the patient is was intubated and vented requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the ventilator initially with respiratory acidosis with poor o two due to vent disynchrony but this improved with increased sedation patient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably but the continued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due to demonstrated poor chest wall compliance seen on inspiratory hold and current cardiac disease despite aggressive bronchodilator therapy steroids and antibiotic therapy she continued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial sedation and paralysis patient per report was tolerating the ventilator at the outside hospital it was unclear what was causing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened after episode patient required paralysis patient esophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a need for peep of eighteen to normalize transplural pressures patient tolerated peep to eighteen with stable blood pressures until stopped paralytics and lightened sedation patient with prolonged expiratory phase and stomachchf grunt during this time period and ce positive pao two changed from one hundred nineteen ninety nine patient placed back on paralytics while paralyzed problem with lung resistence attempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to wean her peep but she continued to need paralysis a decision was made to attempt a pa catheter for better understanding of her hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her during this procedure she suffered asystole with no antecedent arrhythmia noted she was able to be resuscitated but required ventricular pacing her family then decided to withdraw care and ventilator support she subsequently expired from cardiac failure

leukocytosis white blood cell count increasing patient afebrile but on steroids no clear source in the setting of respiratory failure leukocytosis suspicious for pna must also consider stress response with recent nstemidemand episode where patient was found down vs alternative sources for infection also be due to increased steroids for patient pulmonary presentation legionella osh negative she was treated empirically for pneumonia 
hyperglycemia diabetes was quite hyperglycemic at the osh she was covered with at insulin gtt patient amylase and lipase were within normal limits attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for patient pulmonary disease

metabolic acidosis resolved patient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant amount of lactate and had a coronary event when accounting for bicarb it can be explained by patient s lactic acidosis gave back bicarbonate as one liter d five with three amps of bicarb am patient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with two amps bicarbonate

brief hospital course eighty yo woman with severe as chf cri admitted with respiratory failure likely acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure she was diuresed with lasix improving her respiratory function to the point where she no longer required supplemental oxygen but subsequently developed crao leading to stroke workup and anticoagulation with heparin leading to gib due to esophagitis and gastritis leading to transfusion for dropping hematocrit leading to acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to volume overload 
respiratory failure acute on chronic heart failure presented in respiratory distress with sao two eighty two percent on nrb respiratory failure most likely multifactorial involving chronic heart failure due to aortic stenosis exacerbated acutely by volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of decreased lasix dosage intubated in ed extubated on hospital day two continued to require four lnc desaturating to eighty s on room air diuresed with multiple boluses of lasix iv gradually weaned to room air with o two saturation in mid to high ninety s while resting but desaturating deeply to upper eighty s with ambulation unfortunately she subsequently developed a gib leading to transfusion of multiple units of prbcs resulting in shifts in volume status and worsening oxygen saturations and increasing need for supplemental oxygen she was once again diuresed with multiple doses of lasix iv at times requiring combination with metolazone she was gradually weaned off of oxygen until she no longer required supplemental oxygen and was euvolemic on exam 
gib vomited a large quantity of blood after starting heparin has a history of gastritis on recent admission in gi was consulted and egd done showing gastritis and esophagitis but no frank bleeding she was started on an iv ppi and antiemetics she was initially transfused two units of blood in the setting of the acute bleed and subsequently received another unit for gradually decreasing hematocrit of note even before her episode of acute gib her stools were noted to be guaiac positve gi felt that given that the gib occurred in the setting of being started on heparin and having a previous history of gastritis there was no need to arrange for gi follow up unless she desired 
central retinal artery occlusion awoke one afternoon with sudden loss of vision in r eye ophthalmology was consulted and diagnosed patient with likely crao paracentesis was performed to lower intraocular pressure neurology consulted for stroke workup ct and mri showed signs of old ischemia and infarction but no acute events started on heparin drip for concern about emboli but heparin discontinued for gib carotid ultrasound showed thrombus in l ij possibly related to recently removed cordis but otherwise no significant stenosis an appointment was made for her to follow up with a retinal specialist of note she reports that she is already followed by a retinal specialist at the meei for her macular degeneration 
aortic stenosis currently sp recent valvuloplasty with valve area zero point nine cm evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery felt to be poor surgical candidate both for valve replacement and for apico aortic conduit given significantly calcified aorta small body habitus and poor renal function cardiothoracic surgery recommended considering enrollment in percutaneous valve trial

secondary diagnoses aortic stenosis coronary artery disease pulmonary edema chronic renal insufficiency hypertension anemia with chronic gi bleed scoliosis 
discharge condition stable vital signs with appropriate follow up 
discharge instructions you were admitted with acute respiratory distress due to fluid in your lungs when you initially presented you required intubation and mechanical ventilation to provide you with adequate oxygenation 
your aortic stenosis which is the narrowing of one of your heart valves makes it very difficult to manage your fluid status you were evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery to see if they would suggest replacing your aortic valve but they felt that you would not be a good candidate for surgery because of your other medical conditions which would make surgery extremely risky 
you were treated with lasix to decrease the amount of fluid in your lungs improving your ability to breathe your ability to breathe gradually improved to the point that you did not require supplemental oxygen 
you developed a loss of vision in your right eye you were seen by an ophthalmologist who made a small hole in your eye to drain some fluid and diagnosed you with likely central retinal artery occlusion a condition in which a vessel supplying blood to the eye becomes clogged you were started on anticoagulation with heparin 
you developed a gastrointestinal bleed vomiting a quantity of blood and having a number of maroon colored stools you were seen by a gastrointestinologist who performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing esophagitis and gastritis heparin was discontinued and you were started on iv proton pump inhibitors 
a sample of your blood showed that you had an infection in your blood with a bacteria known as viridans streptococci you were initially started on ceftriaxone an antibiotic to treat this bacteria because the particular bacteria you were infected with turned out to be resistant to penicillin the ceftriaxone was discontinued and you were treated with vancomycin you will require treatment with vancomycin for a total of six weeks until a picc line a special type of iv line was placed so that you can continue to receive the vancomycin at home 
your hemodialysis catheter was removed because you had not required dialysis recently it was felt that the catheter was not necessary the tip of the cathether was noted to have another type of bacteria on it staphylococcus aureus this bacteria was resistant to many antibiotics and required treatment with vancomycin you were treated with vancomycin for the staphylococcus aureus this infection required only treatment for five seven days so this bacteria has probably been adequately treated already 
when you first were admitted to the hospital your kidneys were functioning poorly your creatinine which increases when your kidneys are not working well reached a peak of two point seven as we treated you with lasix and decreased the amount of fluid in your body your kidney function actually improved 
you were noted to be somewhat anemic when you first came in your hematocrit was near thirty it gradually dropped to approximately twenty you were given two units of blood and your hematocrit increased to the upper twenty s subsequently your hematocrit dropped again after you had your gi bleed you were again transfused two units of blood a few days later your hematocrit was noted to trend down so you were transfused another unit 
please take all medications as prescribed medication changes your aspirin was changed to eighty one mg daily your carvedilol was increased and your prilosec increased to twice daily your cozaar is being held because of your renal function vancomycin was started to treat bacteria in your blood sevelamer was started to regulate the phosphate level in your blood as your kidneys are not working as well to remove it
